<p class="center f2">THE HISTORY OF SALT.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">INTRODUCTION.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> frequently it happens that those natural productions with
which we are to a certain extent superficially familiar, are to a
great many not only uninteresting, but are regarded as subjects more
or less beneath their notice; and by others as deleterious to the
human race, and therefore to be cautiously used or scrupulously
avoided. Another peculiarity is, that the more we are accustomed
to them, the more our interest wanes, and probably at last degenerates
into apathetic indifference.</p>

<p>We can only attribute these ignorant conceits and apparently
unaccountable obliquity of judgment to two causes: an assumption
of wisdom, and an unenlightened mind, unwilling to learn and
loath to improve. Another hindrance which to a considerable
extent precludes the study of what one may truthfully designate
every-day subjects, is the restless <i>furor</i> for artful counterfeits of
science, which are nothing else than the emanations of vain and
visionary minds mixing together, as it were, an amalgam of truth
and error. The present age is wonderfully productive of these
eccentric ideas, while at the same time it is unhappily pregnant
with the most unnatural and anti-healthful habits. The mystified
authors take good care to run into the wildest extremes, so that
their marvellous schemes and quaint devices (fortunately for their
fellow-creatures) cause them to be justly derided by the thoughtful
and disregarded by the sensible, though not a few are caught by
the tinsel.</p>

<p>The grotesque aberrations of thought which have so prolifically<span class="pagenum">8</span>
generated such an incongruous medley of medico-social phantasmagoria,
though considered by their promoters as wonderful
scientific projections, are rendered more ridiculous than they
really are, by their wild and unreasonable denunciations of those
who do not happen to coincide with their farcical puerilities and
whimsical crudities; and their intolerant followers, with considerable
more zeal than discretion, promulgate their doctrines with
voluminous additions and preposterous assertions—<i>mentis gratissimus
error</i>.</p>

<p>These parodies of science have exerted as yet no material influence
on modern thought, though there is a visible impress observable
here and there; and they doubtless will ultimately collapse,
like alchemy and other illusions of a bygone age, and in due time will
fall as ignominiously before the resistless onslaughts of true science
and knowledge, as those deceptive will-o’-the-wisps were finally
extinguished, after whisking about for some centuries, by the calm,
dignified, and logical condemnation of philosophical and scientific
investigation. Need I remind my reader that I am referring
to spiritualism, homœopathy, vegetarianism, and various other
bastard distortions of science, though their purblind believers
may regard them as legitimate offspring, and therefore deserving
of due respect and consideration. Such imaginative plerophory
is invariably antagonistic to scientific conclusions and common-sense
principles, beside being redundant of inane folly and trivial
hyperbole.</p>

<p>One of the peculiar crazes of the day, though it is not so
universal as those to which I have just referred, is the unhealthful
and insensate antipathy to salt, which has infatuated, in a greater
or lesser degree, the several strata of society: some going so far as
to proscribe it altogether, whilst others use it as if it were destructive
to life, or at least subversive of health, and others assert
that it originates disease! Some time ago I saw a letter in a
temperance journal (we know that the advocates of total abstinence
are frequently guilty of degrading their good cause by descending
to frivolity), advising total abstention from salt; the writer, with
amusing self-complacency, accused it of producing evils of an
astounding nature—such is the latitude of pragmatical ignorance
and silly egotism. The palpable absurdity of such an argument
must be apparent even to the most careless thinker; it is with the
view of exposing such a fallacy, both injurious and irrational, that
I have written this treatise, and have been prompted to do so more<span class="pagenum">9</span>
especially as I find such ridiculous notions find great favour with
those from whom better things ought to be expected.</p>

<p>I have laboured under many difficulties, owing to the meagre
accounts concerning the history of this most important article of
diet; no doubt arising from the fact that it has not been studied
with that attention which it manifestly deserves; consequently I
have been obliged to allude to the pages of Holy Writ, not that I
wish to base my arguments on religion, but simply because we find
therein the primary mention of salt, both as a purifying agent and
as a condiment to food.</p>

<p>Reverting to the Bible on subjects of scientific import frequently
brings down upon the author ill-timed ridicule, especially from those
who profess a belief in nothing except their own crude notions; a
fact which is surprising, for here we possess a Book which has
stood the test of ages, which has weathered many a storm, which
has victoriously emerged from many a conflict, and which has indeed
passed through an ordeal which no other volume has been called
upon to do—all indicative that it emanated from a mind immeasurably
superior to that of man; and thus I am quite content
to bear with any amount of satire, however pointed and
keen, if I have it on my side of the question, which undoubtedly
is the case respecting the medicinal and dietetic properties of salt:
besides, when it is pronounced to be “good” by the Divine
Speaker, one need not care an iota for those who assert that it is
pernicious, however plausible or apparently logically conclusive their
arguments may be.</p>

<hr />
<h2 style="page-break-before: always;"><a name="CII" id="CII">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">HISTORY OF SALT.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> approaching a subject somewhat novel and indeed difficult,
and very probably it may be regarded by some as one far from
being profitable or interesting; therefore I shall endeavour, though
with some degree of diffidence, to consider it not only from a
medical point of view, but to glance at some facts, both historical,
geographical, and geological. By so doing, we shall be touching
upon other matters not only pleasing but instructive, and which to
a great many are but indifferently known; for though salt is to be
almost universally seen on the tables of rich and poor alike, yet<span class="pagenum">10</span>
few are aware of its undeniable medicinal virtues, and many are
totally ignorant of the great sustenance they derive from this indispensable
and undoubtedly savoury condiment, besides being but
moderately acquainted with its history. At the present time it is
used nearly all over the world, and is acknowledged to be at least
an adjunct necessary for perfect cookery; it is in requisition in
fact everywhere, and even those who do not use it would be considered
as lacking in taste were they to discard it altogether from
their tables.</p>

<p>All, however, are to a certain extent cognisant of the fact of how
insipid the daintiest dishes taste, if salt is omitted in their preparation,
and the cook, however expert he may be in the culinary art,
invariably fails in giving satisfaction (except to those whose
palates are deranged or vitiated) if they are not seasoned with
it; few, I think, will deny that animal food in particular is
deprived of its pleasing flavour if it be eaten without salt. Those
who have an unnatural aversion to it should bear in mind that
the ingestion of improper animal and vegetable food frequently
occasions many severe attacks of illness, and invariably provokes
and intensifies that universal complaint, dyspepsia. George Herbert
tells us in his <i>Jacula Prudentum</i>, that “Whatever the father of
disease, ill diet is the mother;” and if food is taken into the stomach
without its proper portion of salt, it is not what one would consider
as wholesome; on the contrary, it is most decidedly “ill diet:”
and being such, the system does not derive that kind of nutriment
suitable for the promotion of a healthy action of the organs
of the body, neither are the secretions in such a condition as is
compatible with health. Physiologists inform us that the saliva<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
holds salt in solution, and that it is also present in the gastric
juice, which indicates at once how highly necessary it is for the
system to be regularly supplied with it; for it is a physiological
fact that the process of deglutition and digestion is partly due to
the disintegrating and solvent action of these two secretions on
the food, especially the latter; and consequently if the nutritious
particles are to be absorbed in a state fit to make up for the waste
of tissue, they ought to contain a sufficient amount of the chloride
of sodium to take the place of that which has passed off through
the media of the skin and the kidneys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">11</span></p>

<p>With these self-evident facts and a few physiological data before
them (which really require no great effort to prove, so plain are
they in their simple truth), all indeed must, or should be, convinced
of the necessity of a liberal and judicious use of a substance which
plays such an important part in the animal economy, and into
which we shall enter more fully when we come to consider the
relation which salt bears to food while it is going through the process
of digestion.</p>

<p>Owing to the peculiar and incomprehensible prejudices of those
who labour under the false impression that they are wiser and more
discriminating than others, and who become proportionately obstinate
in their notions, we shall endeavour to bring forward undeniable
evidence in support of our arguments, though it is possible
they may neither acknowledge that they are wrong, nor admit that
their preconceived ideas prevent them from arriving at an unbiased
conclusion. To such I have no hesitation in saying that
they are much deceived if they imagine that the habit of abstaining
from salt is contributive to health; such crabbed and confined
views, however, are significant of the fact that human nature is
frequently antagonistic to, and at cross purposes with, that which is
ordained by the laws of nature to be beneficial.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the merits of salt as a seasoning to food, as it
is my object to consider it solely in its relation to the animal
economy, its operation in certain morbid conditions of the system,
and its great importance as a health-preserver. But before proceeding,
it will be as well to give a passing glance at its
history and other attractive matter with which it is indirectly in
relation; for though our investigations will be rather of a tentative
character, and in a degree speculative, they may at least be interesting
if not instructive. Perhaps others may be stimulated to
penetrate deeper into the almost impenetrable obscurity with
which the discovery of salt as a condiment is surrounded; and
if they can bring to light who it was that primarily found out the
chloride of sodium and utilised it as an adjunct to food, they will
have solved a geological problem, and a long-standing historical
enigma will be elucidated.</p>

<p>We possess no distinct and reliable data, and in fact no information
of any kind, concerning salt in the early ages of the
world as an article of diet, outside the pages of Scripture: all we
really know, is, that in the infantile period of Europe, when the
Indo-Germanic tribes entered it from Asia, though they were unacquainted<span class="pagenum">12</span>
with the sea, they were familiar with salt, as is proved
by the recurrence of its name; yet whether they used it with their
food we are by no means so sure of. The Kitchen-Middeners, who
had their miserable dwellings on the wild shores of Jutland and
similar inhospitable localities, <i>might</i> have been acquainted with it;
but when we call to mind the nature of the food<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> on which they
lived, we may, I think, fairly conclude that they were ignorant of
the use to which salt is now put; here again, however, we
have only vague conjecture to fall back upon. The founder of
Buddhism, Arddha Chiddi, a native of Capila near Nepaul, who
subsequently changed his name to Gotama, and afterwards to Chakia
Mouni, in his “Verbal Instructions,” when dealing with his inquiry
into the nature of man, asks us to consider what becomes of a grain
of salt when cast into the ocean. Of the epoch of Gotama, or
Chakia Mouni, there is great diversity of opinion; the Chinese,
Mongols, and Japanese fix it at <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C</span>. 1000; the Cashmerians at <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
1332; and the Avars, Siamese, and Cingalese fix it at <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 600.</p>

<p>The reference which Gotama thus makes to salt shows us that
he was familiarly acquainted with it, otherwise he would not have
figuratively mentioned it.</p>

<p>We are completely in the dark regarding salt as a condiment till
Moses, in the Book of Job, asks the pertinent question, “Can anything
which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?” As this book
was penned <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1520, we may conclude with a tolerable degree of
certainty that it was so used in the time of the great Jewish Law-giver,
and as he was brought up in the court of Pharaoh, and
was skilled in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, it would point
to the probability that salt was in common use in that ancient
country.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> mention we possess of salt is when Moses refers to
the Vale of Siddim, which is the Salt Sea. This vast reservoir
was known as the Dead Sea,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and is so to this day: so the Jews,
who were commanded to use salt in their sacrifices, had a large
<span class="pagenum">13</span>natural depôt which afforded them a limitless supply of the necessary
material for carrying on their worship, and likewise for individual
consumption: they also mixed a certain amount of salt with their
incense. The second reference is in relation to one of those
extraordinary incidents with which the first five books of the Old
Testament teem, and that is during the destruction of the “Cities
of the Plain,” when Lot’s wife was turned into a pillar of salt for
disobedience.</p>

<p>We also read of salt in the Iliad of Homer, and as he did not
flourish till about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 850,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> we must give the honour of marking
it indelibly on the pages of history to Moses the Jew, who lived,
if the above date is correct, 670 years anterior to the illustrious
Father of epic poetry, and, if the Cashmerians are correct in their
calculation, 188 years before Gotama gave to the world his eight
hundred volumes, pointing out the path towards individual extinction
or “Nirwana.”</p>

<p>We may likewise conclude that as it was known to the sagacious
Hebrew, the æsthetic Greek, and the imaginative Asiatic, it was no
doubt equally well known to the Egyptians, and probably amongst
the neighbouring African tribes, long before the arrival of Joseph
in the land of the Pharaohs, and centuries before the Oracle of
Delphi was instituted.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>From the following lines we may justly conclude that the Greeks
looked upon salt as sacred, and used it as a thank-offering, and
that it even was an absolute necessity to go through the ceremony
of washing their hands before touching it; such extreme care and
scrupulous observance indicates that it was a substance held in the
highest reverence:</p>

<p>At the time of the Exodus, Egypt was the great disseminator of
knowledge, the centre of civilisation, and the emporium of trade,
being then at its zenith of prosperity and power;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and the
countries which were conterminous no doubt regarded it with
feelings of admiration and emulation, and were only too desirous to
adopt its customs, as well as to avail themselves of the learning
and culture which were only to be found in the land of obelisks
and pyramids. Even the Greek philosophers were fain to acknowledge
that Egypt<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> was their storehouse of wisdom and æsthetic
art; neither Athenian, Spartan, or Corinthian, ever disavowed his
presumed Egyptian descent: and if history is to be relied on,
the first King of Attica was a citizen of Sais; though this is
a disputed point, for not only is the country of Cecrops a
topic for controversy, but even his very existence is questioned,
and by some altogether denied. This legend, if it is such, however,
tends to show that the communication between the two
countries (though of the two, Egypt was much more exclusive) was
frequent; however, it is still a theme upon which classical commentators
continue to exercise their controversial dexterity, some
of whom affirm that there is no foundation for the myth. Yet
many philosophical authors who flourished in Athens believed implicitly
in the Egyptian genealogy of Cecrops; so that there is no
<span class="pagenum">15</span>reason why it should be stamped as fictitious, especially when it
is verified by those who lived closer to that period of time than
the incredulous moderns, whose great delight is to hint that many
past historical events are incredible, and therefore apocryphal. I
think we may certainly conclude that the sage discriminating
Athenians were acquainted with their Egyptian descent,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> for they
were the last people to believe in uncertainties, save such as were
connected with their religion; and what nation is there, I should
like to know, which is not similarly imposed upon by its own
strange credulity, and the artful designs of schemers in this particular?</p>

<p>Cecrops, no doubt, while he introduced Egyptian arts and sciences
into his adopted country, was too wise, and too well conversant
with such an important commodity as salt, to forget both its
existence and utility, on his arrival in the peninsula. Presuming
for one moment that the emigration of Cecrops from Egypt
is a fable, it is indicative of the fact that a perpetual intercourse,
though of a modified nature, existed between that country and
Greece. We know, however, that both Egyptian and Grecian
histories, about the period of Cecrops, are involved in much obscurity
and uncertainty (particularly as regards dates); and if,
therefore, Cecrops and his foundation of a Pelasgic colony in Attica
is a mythological tale, we may justly infer that Greece, owing to
the greater antiquity of Egypt, imitated many of the social customs
which were in vogue in the ancient and luxurious cities of the
Nile.</p>

<p>We are also aware that at this early age, with a few brilliant
exceptions like Egypt (we possess no reliable records of China,
Japan, or Hindostan<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>) the world was in a state of mental stagnation—chaotic
is more descriptive: the thoughtful and mystical Egyptians
were really the only recipients and parsimonious (if historical accounts
are to be credited) disseminators of knowledge to their neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">16</span></p>

<p>Many centuries later, we find a very remarkable instance of this
influence of Egypt, which, though of a religious character, bears
indirectly on our subject, by exemplifying this intellectual supremacy;
the worship of Isis was established even in Imperial Rome
herself, and we are told that the goddess was a most popular
divinity amongst the wealthy citizens, a temple being erected to her
honour in the Campus Martius; while she was designated by
her enthusiastic worshippers, Isis Campensus. Now, though an
Egyptian goddess was admitted with so much apparent readiness
to occupy such an exalted position in the capital of the empire,
when the Romans, with supercilious toleration, allowed the worship
of as many gods as the people chose to venerate, yet the fact of
building a temple for her exclusive worship, when all the other gods
and goddesses were mixed and scattered hither and thither, without
the slightest regard to order or attributes, is sufficient proof to substantiate
the truth of my argument; and again if we call to mind
the jealous pride of the Romans, and their disinclination to conform
to the habits and customs of the countries which succumbed
to their iron will, the admission of Isis to such elevated and almost
unprecedented honours, would tend to show that many customs of
Egyptian origin were not only adopted by the haughty Roman,
but also by the Jew, Greek, Assyrian, and Persian, with a willingness
in proportion to their utility, ornamentation, and agreeableness;
and in some instances in deference to the intellectual
ascendancy and scientific acquirements of this ancient people.</p>

<p>The Egyptians, owing to the central position of their country,
the knowledge they were known to possess, their unrivalled skill
in irrigation, the sublimity of their architecture, the abstruse
wisdom of their priests, the mysterious erudition of their astrologers,
and their wonderful agricultural proficiency and renown, caused
their country to be frequently visited (sometimes by stealth, owing
to their stringent laws against the admission of foreigners) by Greeks,
Phœnicians, Assyrians, and Chaldeans, and indeed by all who
professed the study<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> of science, learning, and philosophy; so that
we may be sure they very naturally carried back to their respective
countries many of the domestic customs, as well as the knowledge
<span class="pagenum">17</span>of their learned entertainers and instructors. The great city of
Thebes stood to Ethiopia, as well as to Egypt, in the same relation as
that occupied by Rome to mediæval Christendom: the construction
of her temples and palaces, and the vast population of priests and
their thousands of attendants, in addition to the presence of the court,
must have attracted thither multitudes of merchants, artists, artisans,
and indeed travellers from all parts; for it was the centre in those
days of civilisation and commerce; and it was easy of access, for
an opening in the Arabian Sea afforded communication with the port
of Kosseir on the Red Sea; while on the other side, the city was
the best starting-point for the caravan routes across the desert to
the three chief <i>oases</i> (the Greater, the Lesser, and that of Ammon),
and to the interior of Africa. Thus Egypt, through Thebes, commanded
the trade with India, and with the gold, ivory, and
aromatic districts; and the mines of the neighbouring limestone hills
added to her enormous wealth, and gave employment to thousands.</p>

<p>There is another point which we must not overlook, and that is,
the Egyptians did not remain secluded in their own country, though
they were jealous of the entry of strangers. They were a courageous
and seafaring people (though much inferior in that respect to the
adventurous Phœnicians), as far as the times went; for they engaged
in many nautical enterprises after Psammetichus, about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 670,
had completely overthrown the ancient system of isolation, showing
their dormant marine proclivities, which had hitherto been but
secretly indulged in.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Before these barriers had been broken
down, their expeditions, as far as we know, never extended beyond
the ancient Pillars of Hercules, which was regarded as an extraordinary
exploit in those days (so we are told). One thing we may
be practically certain of—wherever they went they carried with
them not only their learning, but also their own peculiar customs
and habits; and doubtless they experienced a satisfaction and pride
in displaying their superiority not only in matters appertaining to
knowledge, but also in civilisation. May we not justly infer that
in their peregrinations they promulgated the utility and advantages
of such a valuable commodity as salt wherever they went,
wherever they settled? And would not the various peoples whom
they visited, after having once experienced the palatableness of
salt, take to it with an eagerness approaching avidity? The follow<span class="pagenum">18</span>ing
paragraph, which I have extracted <i>in extenso</i> from the work of
a highly gifted American author, and which is, I am proud to say,
confirmatory of my own observations, delineates in a most forcible
and graphic style the wonderful pitch of excellence in the sciences
to which the Egyptians had attained, and their remarkable approach
to the goal of indefectibility.</p>

<p>“The hieroglyphic writing had passed through all its stages of
formation; its principles had become ascertained and settled long
before we gain the first glimpse of it; the decimal and duodecimal
systems of arithmetic were in use; the arts necessary in hydraulic
engineering, massive architecture, and the ascertainment of the
boundaries of land, had reached no insignificant degree of perfection.
Indeed, there would be but very little exaggeration in affirming
that we are practically as near the early Egyptian as was
Herodotus himself. Well might the Egyptian priests say to the
earliest Greek philosophers: ‘You Greeks are mere children, talkative
and vain; you know nothing at all of the past.’”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>There is another channel which we will now take into consideration:
the Philistines, who are supposed to have been descended
from the Hycksos, or Shepherd Kings of Egypt, must have carried
with them not a few of those customs which were in fashion
amongst the sons of the founders of the gloomy temples of
Memphis and Luxor; and on their expulsion by the regenerated
Egyptians they were probably much assimilated with them, owing
to many years’ intercourse, and being located in the same country,
though their nationalities were entirely distinct and their habits
antagonistic, and notwithstanding the dislike the Egyptians had
for, and their abhorrence of all those who were connected with, the
grazing and the breeding of cattle; for whenever two nations mix
promiscuously, however limited it may be, they are sure to adopt
more or less each other’s peculiarities, both in language and customs.
These Philistines, when they emigrated on their defeat, took with
them Egyptian civilisation, and the various tribes surrounding their
newly acquired territory were very soon initiated into customs of
which, perhaps, they were previously ignorant. There is nothing
to prove this, but we may certainly surmise as much, if only by inference.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">19</span></p>

<p>Though we possess no historical record, we may, owing to the
influence which Egypt doubtless exerted over the civilised parts
of Europe, come to the conclusion that through her instrumentality
the use of salt was made known to the surrounding nations and
tribes; the sons of Jacob and their families were not sufficiently
numerous to render them important in the estimation of their
neighbours, nor were they powerful enough to extort respect or
generate emulation.</p>

<p>We learn from Herodotus, who was born <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 484, that the
Egyptians eat salted food, but nothing as regards using it in the
same way as we do. He says, “They live on fish, raw, but sun-dried,
or steeped in brine; they eat also raw quails and ducks, and
the smaller birds, salted beforehand.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> The climate of Egypt,
being remarkably dry and hot, would soon cause the decomposition
of fresh animal food, and the Egyptians doubtless were aware
of the fact that a prolonged immersion in brine or salt would be a
complete deterrent; therefore there is no reason to doubt but that
it was as common a custom amongst them as it is amongst us at
the present day.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> The “Father of History” does not mention
that salt was used as a condiment; though we may presume as
much.</p>

<p>We might feel inclined at first to ascribe the honour of promulgating
the utility of salt to the Hebrews, owing to the fact of one
of their nation being the first to mention it, and of our possessing
no other record of so early a date. Abraham was very probably
cognisant of the virtues of salt, but though he was the founder of
the people whose mission and chief delight was indiscriminate
massacre, he was not one of them, but a Chaldean, a people famed
for their wisdom; besides, he was the progenitor of two nations,
viz. the Hebrews and the Ishmaelites, so that if Isaac was acquainted
with the properties of salt, his half-brother Ishmael was
equally so. Ishmael’s descendants speedily developed into a free,
independent nation, while Isaac’s became slaves, and were made to
construct costly monuments, build gigantic palaces, and raise
majestic temples for their highly-cultured and imperious oppressors.</p>

<p>Which branch was likely to be imitated? Not the labouring,
<span class="pagenum">20</span>ignorant Hebrew, smarting under the lash of servitude, but rather
the wandering Ishmaelite, who roamed at pleasure over the burning
solitudes of Arabia; still, we must remember they were like a
drop in the bucket when compared with their exclusive neighbours
over the Red Sea. We are all aware that to this day the Eastern
custom of placing salt before a guest is a token of amity and goodwill,
and is significant enough to tell the visitor that he is for the
time being in perfect safety; no Arab, even under provocation,
would injure his most violent enemy after having once eaten salt
with him under cover of his tent, till he was out in the desert.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
This custom has descended from generation to generation, and perhaps
was instituted by the exiled son of Abraham and Hagar. This
fact would seem to corroborate my hypothesis, that if the Jews,
through Abraham, were aware of the properties of salt, their wild
brothers of the desert were also acquainted with it, and from the
same source. Where Abraham obtained the knowledge of salt rests
in obscurity; he may have acquired the secret from the Egyptians,
or, as he is termed the friend of the Founder of the Universe, probably
he learnt it from a higher authority. I think we may dismiss
the idea that we owe the discovery of salt to the Hebrews.</p>

<p>Our speculations on this point are, however, comparatively vain,
for we cannot possibly determine who first discovered it, or who
first utilised it as a condiment to food: all we really know is that it
has become universal, and that from time immemorial; but whether
the Egyptians, Chinese, or Hindoos first made use of it, will be one
of those dark secrets the solution of which may interest the curious
and ingenious, and test the patience and erudition of the profound.
Such an investigation might probably be considered by some as
unprofitable, even if it were attended with success. To such I do
not think it will be unjust or irrelevant to observe that many
scientific discussions which from time to time have occupied the
learned world have been, as far as the results are concerned, not of
much moment to humanity at large. For instance, of what practical
utility is the modern theory of evolution, upon which so much
erudition of a minute kind, and thought, is expended, except as
indicative of the ingenuity of the author? Is science at all advanced
when we are gravely told that the human organism springs
<span class="pagenum">21</span>from protoplasm, and that plastidules consist of carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen, and that they possess souls? It is true that
these abstruse inquiries have been productive of inciting a greater
desire for studying the workings of nature, and a great deal of
which previous generations were profoundly ignorant has been ingeniously
disclosed, and accurately elucidated, for one is bound to
admit that, though in many instances their researches have failed in
their ultimate results, they have been the indirect cause of giving a
remarkable impetus to scientific investigation. Many recondite subjects
have thus been exhaustively analysed, unintentionally, owing
to the anxiety and eagerness of the authors to arrive at the goal of
their wishes; for while they are seeking for that which probably
will never be found, they discover others which, to all intents and
purposes, very likely would never have been conceived of. Perhaps
these remarks may be considered unjust and hypercritical as regards
their researches into the mysteries of life, and do not appear to
give sufficient importance to those philosophical deductions and
enunciations, which the authors no doubt demand as an imperative
right; for scientific physicists are apt to be tyrannical, and are not
over-endued with the virtue of practicality, and naturally do not
like their opinions and metaphysical reveries relegated to that region
which Milton humorously baptized the “Paradise of Fools,” but
prefer their speculations to be regarded as irrefragable facts. As
this is, however, the age for far-fetched theories, I think we may
be allowed with perfect fairness to discuss a subject which has partially
escaped the eyes of the inquisitive; and if it is not treated so
elegantly as the learned theses of the leaders of science and philosophy
of to-day, I cannot help thinking that we may probably gain
considerably more by studying a subject which is practically of
interest to all, than attempting to penetrate into the invisible and
undefinable mechanism of biology.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the proofs (vague though they be), which I have
already mentioned to show that we are indebted to the Egyptians
for the discovery of this most valuable substance, I nevertheless do
so with diffidence, because they are of a hypothetical tendency, and
consequently refutable.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> We may endeavour to trace the custom
of using salt as a condiment to several nations, or even to one par<span class="pagenum">22</span>ticular
nation, with as much earnestness as the modern speculatists
attempt to account for unaccountable phenomena appertaining to
the material and spiritual worlds; but, as far as the real evidence
goes, we are as unsuccessful, and our inquiries almost as unsatisfactory,
as theirs have been hitherto.</p>

<p>There is great probability, however, that the Egyptians first made
known to other nations, directly and indirectly, the utility of salt,
and that through their sole agency it was introduced into Europe
through the media of commerce and other channels of communication,
and no doubt, as I have previously stated, in deference to their
superior wisdom. We learn from those scholars who are giving
their attention to Egyptian remains, that Greece was indebted to
Egypt for all her science, architecture, literature, art, and mythology;
and, indeed, her domestic life was derived from that venerable
country. “From Egypt, it now appears, were derived the prototypes
of the Greek architectural orders, and even their monuments
and conventional designs; thence came the models of the Greek
and Etruscan vases; thence came many of the ante-Homeric legends
... thence came the first ritual for the dead, litanies to the sun,
and painted, or illuminated, missals; thence came the dogma of a
queen of heaven!”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>In confirmation of this we are told that Moses, as I have before
remarked, was skilled in Egyptian wisdom: this is most emphatic,
and we cannot but conclude that that wisdom was in a high state of
perfection; and their works, which are still the surprise and admiration
of travellers, testify to the truth of Holy Writ. Do not their
monuments, which have set time at defiance, prove that they were
a people highly gifted? Their ruins are more sublime than any
other architectural remains which are extant, excelling, both in
magnificence and magnitude, the classic temples of Greece, and
the elegant buildings which once graced the banks of the golden
Tiber. In reference to this I may quote Dr. Lepsius, who states
that “all the principal cities of Egypt were adorned with temples
and palaces.... These temples were filled with the statues of
gods and kings, generally colossal, and hewn from costly stones.”</p>

<p>Possibly, owing to the fact that salt is valued almost universally,
and is a substance which has been demonstrated by experience to be
necessary to humanity, it may have been, for all we can say, as well
known to the Antediluvians as it is to us; and if so, then we are
indebted to Noah. But these are but surmises; we really possess
<span class="pagenum">23</span>no authentic record, except that which we find in Holy Writ: and,
with my reader’s leave, we will now proceed to examine those
passages of Scripture in which salt is mentioned.</p>

<p>We find that whenever salt is named, it is done so in language
of a character stamping it as a most important essential; and
especially do we notice this in the directions for the religious
services of the Israelites. They were commanded in the most explicit
language that in all their offerings they should “offer salt.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
There is also another point which we must not omit, and that is,
whenever salt is referred to in the Inspired Volume, it is invariably
in connection with some important transaction: for example, when
Elisha sweetened the waters of the fountain of Jericho, he cast salt
into them; this act of the prophet illustrates, figuratively, the
purifying properties of salt, for he said, “I have healed these
waters.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> When Abimelech captured Shechem, he strewed salt
over the ruins;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and when Abijah harangued Jeroboam from the
Mount Zemaraim, he speaks of a “covenant of salt.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> We read
farther on of this “covenant of salt” in the Book of Numbers.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
In fact, in the Old Testament, as well as in the New, considerable
stress is laid on this evidently important substance, which shows
that nothing was considered as thoroughly accomplished if salt, in
some way or other, was not intimately connected with it.</p>

<p>It was also a custom amongst the Hebrews, which was never
departed from, to rub new-born infants with salt:<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> this practice
was in every respect healthy and cleanly, and if we Christians were
wise we should, from a hygienic point of view, strictly follow a
custom which is so conducive to health; for salt hardens the skin
of newly-born children and renders it more firm, and prevents
(unless there is an hereditary taint) any irritation or local eruption
of the skin.</p>

<p>The first mention of salt as a condiment is to be found in Job;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
and as this beautiful book, which delineates the vicissitudes to
which life is subjected, is supposed to have been written by Moses
when he was dwelling amongst the Midianites, there is no doubt
but that it was in general use not only in Egypt, but also amongst
the surrounding nations. The answer to the question propounded
by the persecuted man of Uz is the same now as it was three
thousand years ago—there is nothing savoury without salt, and to
a certainty there is no real permanent health without salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">24</span></p>

<p>The Jews, like all Asiatic races, were much afflicted with various
forms of leprosy, and as salt is an indirect antidote to cutaneous
eruptions, they used it not so much as a condiment, but as a shield
to ward off and protect them from those repulsive diseases which
rendered those who were attacked obnoxious to their fellow-countrymen,
by whom they were treated as outcasts till they had recovered
from their loathsome maladies. To this day we find that by far the
greater number who suffer from cutaneous diseases hardly ever eat
salt with their food; this is an unquestionable fact, and truly significant
of its inestimable virtue as an anti-morbific agent.</p>

<p>The Great Master says (and who will dispute such an unanswerable
verity?) “salt is good;” and then He adds, “but if the
salt has lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it?”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Addressing
His disciples, He says: “Ye are the salt of the earth,” and also,
“Have salt in yourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> These sayings prove in the most unmistakable
language that salt is highly necessary. Our Saviour
applies it in a religious sense, it is true, but He was too much of a
philosopher, too great a logician, to use a metaphor of which the
application could be shaken and disproved in the abstract, if the
image or figure were fundamentally incorrect or inconsistent with
the lesson which it was intended to convey; besides, He never
would have declared it “good” had it been in the slightest degree
provocative of anything deleterious to the human race, neither
would He have made use of a figurative mode of speech if He
could not have based it on a physical fact.</p>

<p>We are thus told in three simple words the value of salt, and
none save the shallow, or the sophist, would attempt to prove the
contrary. All must acknowledge the fact that salt is equally
pleasant to the gourmand and the temperate; and that animal and
vegetable food is not palatable without it. As it is pronounced to
be “good” by the highest authority, we must regard it as one of
Heaven’s best gifts to man. It would be a comparatively small
matter were it but a condiment rendering food more pleasant to
the taste; but when we know that it is indirectly a preserver of
health, and that it also contravenes the attacks of disease, its value
will, I hope, be considerably increased.</p>

<p>I shall be more than satisfied if I am able to persuade those unwise
people who make it a rule never to use salt, to resort to it at
once without hesitation; for if they wish to be in a fair state of
health, to have clear wholesome skins and fresh complexions, to be
<span class="pagenum">25</span>free from intestinal parasites and cutaneous diseases, to have their
digestive organs perform their functions compatible with health
and personal comfort, they must have, practically speaking, salt in
themselves.</p>

<p>We have thus, from very scanty records concerning salt, essayed
to clear up, though very inconclusively, and I fear unsatisfactorily,
certain points which have been unnoticed, by reason, I think, of
the dense obtenebration with which the subject is surrounded; for
it has hitherto baffled the researches of the geologist to discover its
pristine source, and neither do we know who first used it as a condiment.
The chemist can experimentalise with this inorganic substance
to detect the presence of other bodies, and he knows its
worth in the laboratory; but as for its origin, he is as much in the
dark as the geologist.</p>

<p class="center lowercase"><span class="smcap">SALT AS A CHEMICAL, THERAPEUTICAL, AND TOXICOLOGICAL AGENT.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a chemical agent, and from the manufacturing uses to which it
is now put, salt is a most invaluable article from a scientific as well
as from a commercial point of view. I will therefore draw the
attention of my reader to its chemical properties; I will then
allude to a few drugs which are partially derived from salt or the
chloride of sodium; and will cursorily notice one great staple of
commerce which owes the rapidity of manufacture to its sole
agency, including some remarks on it as a poison.</p>

<p><i>Chlorine</i> gas, which is obtained from the <i>chloride of sodium</i>, was
discovered by Scheele in 1777, who named it <i>dephlogisticated
muriatic acid</i>. Berthollet in 1785 termed it <i>oxygenated muriatic
acid</i>. Sir Humphry Davy called it <i>chlorine</i> (from χλωρὸς,
green) on account of its colour, and it has kept this name ever
since. We thus see that salt is of great use to the chemist, for he
not only obtains <i>chlorine</i> gas from it, but also <i>hydrochloric acid</i>, a
most useful and efficacious drug in the treatment of some hepatic
diseases. <i>Chlorine</i> also enters into combination with other chemical
substances known as <i>chlorides</i> and <i>chlorates</i>, <i>sub-chlorides</i> and <i>per-chlorides</i>;
for instance, we have the <i>chloride of ammonium</i> and the
<i>chlorate of potash</i>; we also have the <i>sub-chloride of mercury</i>, or<span class="pagenum">26</span>
<i>calomel</i>, and the <i>perchloride of mercury</i>, or <i>corrosive sublimate</i>, with
various others.</p>

<p>According to Pereira, <i>hydrochloric acid</i> was known to Djafar, or
Geber, an Arabian chemist who flourished in the eighth century,
and whom Roger Bacon calls <i>magister magistrorum</i>. Everyone is
acquainted with the <i>chloride of lime</i>, a substance so generally used
for household and disinfecting purposes, that I need only mention
it; besides this, there are other salts with which <i>chlorine</i> enters
into combination.</p>

<p>Formerly, to bleach cotton it was required to expose the material
to the action of the sun and air, rendering the process long and
tedious, as it took on the average quite six or eight months, and
likewise a large surface of land was necessary for the operation.</p>

<p>Now, owing to <i>chlorine</i> gas, the process is completed in a few
hours, and a comparatively small building is quite sufficient for the
purpose; the fibre is beautifully and permanently whitened, and
the manufacturer experiences the pleasing satisfaction of a more
rapid remuneration.</p>

<p>Where would be our delicately white textile fibres were it not
for the abundant and inexhaustible supply of salt? How should
we be enabled to cause vegetable colours to vanish as if touched
by the hand of a magician were it not for the bleaching properties
of <i>chlorine</i>? And how should we be able to procure this green-coloured
gas which produces these changes were it not for the
<i>chloride of sodium</i>?</p>

<p>As a therapeutical agent <i>chlorine</i> possesses some characteristics
peculiar to itself: it is used as a lotion for cancerous growths and
foul ulcers, also for some cutaneous eruptions. It is likewise used
as a vapour-bath; it has also been used in the treatment of chronic
bronchitis and phthisis, and as a gargle in certain morbid conditions
of the mouth. When <i>chlorine</i> is absorbed by the system it is supposed
to possess some antiseptic and alterative action, acting
specifically on the liver.</p>

<p>There is one more fact of a chemical nature in reference to
chlorine which it would be unwise to throw aside, as it possesses
some degree of interest. When the chemist wishes to decompose
water, or in other words to liberate hydrogen from oxygen, he has
no better agent to effect the purpose than this greenish-coloured
gas, because it has such a strong affinity for <i>hydrogen</i>, which is one
of the most characteristic properties of <i>chlorine</i>. Mix them together,
and they combine with explosive violence if they are exposed to<span class="pagenum">27</span>
the beams of the sun. By this process we obtain <i>hydrochloric acid</i>
gas, while the <i>oxygen</i> is liberated.</p>

<p><i>Chlorine</i> only becomes active when it is associated with moisture;
when dry it is quite inert as regards its bleaching powers, for
“when moist it gradually decomposes the water, combining with
its <i>hydrogen</i>, and disengaging its <i>oxygen</i>; and it is this <i>oxygen</i>, at
the moment of its liberation, which is the really active agent in
bleaching.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Salt, like other inorganic compounds, has been known to act as
a poison when taken in a large quantity, and Dr. Alfred Taylor, the
eminent toxicologist, mentions a case in which a table-spoonful
was taken by mistake for sugar; there was no vomiting or purging,
but great pain in the region of the stomach, with dryness of the
fauces, which lasted several days. Did not the above emanate
from so great an authority, one would feel inclined to question it.
Could anyone take such a large amount and swallow the same
without being immediately aware of his mistake? Surely he would
have immediately and spasmodically ejected it by reason of its
extremely pungent character, before it had even reached the fauces.</p>

<p>Dr. Taylor says that “in a toxicological view it is not easy to
distinguish the effects of common salt in these cases from the
poisonous action of salt of sorrel, or binoxalate of potash, which it is
well known may be taken with impunity in small quantity;” the
symptoms are those of irritant poisoning, causing great pain and
intensely inflaming the stomach and intestines, and in those few
cases which we have on record the vomiting was excessive.</p>

<p>In France, though not hitherto, as far as I am aware, in Great
Britain, several instances have occurred of severe sickness in particular
localities, which have been traced to the adulteration of
common salt with certain deleterious articles. In an investigation
conducted by M. Guibourt some years ago, in consequence of some
severe accidents which were presumed to have been produced apparently
by salt in Paris and at Meaux, oxide of arsenic was detected;
and this discovery was corroborated by MM. Latour and
Lefrançois, who ascertained that the proportion of arsenic was
sometimes a quarter of a grain per ounce. Another peculiar adulteration
which was frequent was with the hydriodate of soda. At
a meeting of the Parisian Academy of Medicine, held in December,
1829, an interesting report was read by MM. Boullay and Delens,
subsequent to the inquiry by M. Sérullas, into the nature of a
<span class="pagenum">28</span>sample of salt which occasioned very extensive ravages. In the
year 1829 various epidemic illnesses in several parishes were supposed
to have originated from salt of bad quality, and in one month
no less than 150 people in two parishes were attacked, some with
nausea and pain in the stomach, slimy and bloody purging, some
with tension of the abdomen, puffiness of the face, inflammation
of the eyes, and œdema of the legs; and in some districts
of the Marne one-sixth part of the inhabitants were affected in a
similar manner. The salt being suspected, as it had an unusual
odour somewhat like the effluvia of marsh land, it was analysed by
M. Sérullas, and after him by MM. Boullay and Delens; the experiments
of all three indicated the presence of one hundredth of its
weight of hydriodate of soda, besides a small amount of free iodine.
Owing to the discovery of arsenic by other experts in different
samples of suspected salt, M. Sérullas repeated the analysis, but
was unable to detect the slightest trace of that poison.</p>

<p>“M. Barruel states that he observed the occasional adulteration
of salt with some hydriodate accidentally in 1824, while preparing
experiments for Professor Orfila’s lectures. He also found it in
two samples from different grocers’ shops in Paris. No satisfactory
explanation has yet been given of the source of the adulteration
with arsenic; but the presence of the hydriodate of soda has been
traced to the fraudulent use of impure salt from kelp.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>MM. St. Claire Deville and Fouqué have shown that common
salt can be resolved into its elements by the action of hot steam
alone, which Lussa and other chemists had thought impossible.</p>

<p>Prof. Meyer, of Berne, has lately demonstrated by experiments on
chlorine gas, that the assumption of its elementary character is an
error, and that it is nothing more or less than the oxide of a metal
which he calls <i>murium</i>. This discovery opens up an interesting
question for physiological chemists to investigate; for if he is
correct, chlorine is not an element, but is simply the oxide of a
metal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salt</span>, fortunately for us, is a commodity remarkably easy to obtain;
almost everyone knows it is in great abundance in the ocean,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
and there are inexhaustible supplies of it in the earth; it is
also present in some rivers, and in no inconsiderable quantity.
Mr. John Ashley, in the <i>Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society</i>,
in his “Analysis of Thames Water,” tells us the exact amount:</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: .9em;"><span class="smcap">Composition of Thames Water at London Bridge in grains per gallon

<p>We may account for this great proportion of salts by the fact
that the Thames collects its water from the drainage of comparatively
soft and soluble rocks; we should also remember the vast
amount of refuse organic and inorganic matter which is being
continually thrown into this river; and we must also call to mind
that it is nothing more or less than the main sewer which receives
the ordure of the modern Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>We may naturally suppose that in those rivers which flow through
sparsely inhabited countries, where there is little or no traffic, the
amount of saline matter would be next to nothing, and probably
not a trace would be discovered. In a river like the Thames, owing
to the vast quantity of its shipping, the great percentage which
Mr. John Ashley has given us need not afford the least surprise.
Sea-water is deficient in its proper proportion of salt at the mouths
of great rivers, where the volume of fresh water displaces that which
properly belongs to the sea, and therefore a river does not obtain
much saline matter from that source.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">30</span></p>

<p>Before we pass on to consider the geographical distribution of
salt, we will just cursorily glance at the position it occupies in the
vegetable world. It is present in all plants growing near the sea,
and in variable quantities in some of those which are in or near
districts where the soil is mixed with salt; though its place is
taken by potash when they grow inland. Dr. Balfour writes as
follows: “Soda and potash occur abundantly in plants. They are
taken up with the soil in combination with acids. Those growing
near the sea have a large proportion of soda in their composition,
whilst those growing inland contain potash. Various species of
salsola, salicornia, halimœnenum, and kochia yield soda for commercial
purposes and are called halophites (ἁλς, salt, and φυτὸν,
plant). The young plants, according to Göbel, furnish more soda
than the old ones. There are certain species, as Armeria maritima,
Cochlearia officinalis, and Plantago maritima, which are found both
on the seashore and high on the mountains removed from the sea.
In the former situation they contain much soda and some iodine;
while in the latter, according to Dr. Dickie, potash prevails and
iodine disappears.”</p>

<p>Soda being present in those plants growing near the sea, and
potash in those which are inland, are two points well worthy
of notice, and which we will now discuss. The number of vegetables
which are cultivated near the coast shrink into insignificance
when compared with those which grow inland; and naturally the
markets are supplied with inland produce on account of a larger
supply, therefore the consumption of those vegetables containing
potash is in the same ratio. This being unquestionably the case,
we ought, on that account alone, to use salt freely with our vegetable
food in order to supply that which is absent, arising from the
difference of locality and dissimilarity of the atmosphere. I shall
enter fully into the relation salt bears to vegetable food while it is
going through the process of digestion further on, when we come to
consider the effects which food salted beforehand has upon the
system when continued for any length of time, with little or no
variation, which dietary is supposed to be the sole cause of the
attacks of scurvy on board ship.</p>

<p>The sea is that grand reservoir which supplies the earth with its
fertility; and the air and sun are mighty engines which work without
intermission to raise the water from this inexhaustible cistern.
The clouds, as aqueducts, convey the genial stores along the atmo<span class="pagenum">31</span>sphere,
and distribute them in seasonable and regular proportions
through all the regions of the globe.</p>

<p>With what difficulty do we extract a drop of perfectly sweet
water from this vast pit of brine! Yet the sun draws off, every
moment, millions of tons in vaporous exhalations, which, being
securely lodged in the clouds, are sent abroad sweetened and refined,
without the least brackish tincture or bituminous sediment; sent
abroad upon the wings of the winds to distil in dews and rain, to
ooze in fountains, to trickle along in rivulets, to roll from the
sides of mountains, to flow in copious streams amid burning deserts
and populous kingdoms, in order to refresh and fertilise, to beautify
and enrich, every soil in every clime.</p>

<p>Though the ocean is salt, yet certain seas do not contain so much
as others; my reader must not therefore conclude that the chloride of
sodium, or salt, is equally diffused in sea-water, for the atmosphere
receives a larger or lesser amount by reason of evaporation. Dr.
Draper writes that the “temperature of the Mediterranean is twelve
degrees higher than that of the Atlantic, and since much of the water
is removed by evaporation, it is necessarily more saline than that
ocean.”</p>

<p>It is said that the southern seas are slightly more salt than the
northern, the reason for which phenomenon has not been, as yet,
satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>It is strange that salt should determine the colour of the sea,
and that for centuries the cause of this peculiar natural phenomenon
of the ocean should have been a closed secret even to men of
science. Even from the earliest times, the origin of this marine
peculiarity has attracted the attention and wonder of navigators;
yet, strange to say, it has only been discovered within the last few
years. The many expeditions which have been despatched by the
Governments of England, Germany, and others, for the express
purpose of oceanic discovery, have been the means of solving a
question which has perplexed all races of seamen from the time of
the Phœnicians, and which astonished Columbus on his voyage to
the Indies.</p>

<p>These recent scientific investigations have proved that the proportion
of salt held in solution by sea-water determines its blue or
green appearance, and also its specific gravity; consequently,
when the water is blue, we may conclude that it holds a much
greater proportion of salt; when it is green, it is indicative that
there is a decrease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">32</span></p>

<p>There is one phenomenon which is peculiarly interesting. There
are two kinds of ice floating in the Arctic and Antarctic seas—the
flat ice and the mountain ice. The one is formed of sea-water, the
other of fresh. The flat or driving ice is entirely composed of salt
water, which, when dissolved, is found to be salt, and is readily
distinguished from the mountain or fresh-water ice by its whiteness
and want of transparency. This ice is much more terrible to
mariners than that which rises in lumps. A ship generally can
avoid the one, as it is seen at a distance; but it frequently gets in
amongst the other, which, sometimes closing with resistless force,
crushes the doomed vessel to pieces.</p>

<p>The surface of that which is congealed from the sea-water is not
only flat, but quite even, hard, and opaque, resembling white sugar,
and incapable of being slid upon.</p>

<p>Salt is found in variable quantities in different countries, and
in various conditions; in one part it may be found as a huge
mountain, in which there are dark and lofty caverns; in others it
is deposited in marshes and lakes, and in others in deep mines,
many hundreds of feet beneath the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>In some countries there are vast quantities of rock or fossil salt.
Salt has been divided into <i>three</i> kinds: native or rock salt;
common or sea salt, also called white-salt; and bay-salt. Under
the title of bay-salt are ranked all kinds of common salt, extracted
from the water, wherever it is dissolved by means of the sun’s heat
and the operation of the air. If sea-water is evaporated by means
of a gentle heat we also obtain what is known as bay-salt. Common
salt, or sea-salt, or white-salt, which is extracted from the sea, is
composed of hydrochloric acid, saturated with soda, and is found
in salt water and salt-springs, also in coal and gypsum-beds. “The
sea itself, if desiccated, would afford a bed of salt five hundred
feet thick, one hundred for every mile.”</p>

<p>In England, and especially in Cheshire, there are large salt-mines,
at Nantwich and Middlewich, which have existed ever since the
Roman occupation of Britain; and in the year 1670 the Staffordshire
salt-mines were discovered, and accordingly excavated. Those
in Cheshire have been renowned for centuries; their great extent
is such that the surface has subsided on account of its being undermined
for so many miles.</p>

<p>“In England, the Trias is the chief repository of salt, or chloride
of sodium; and brine-springs, which are subterranean streams of
water impregnated with salt from percolating through saliferous<span class="pagenum">33</span>
strata, are abundant in the great plain of the red marls and
sandstones of Cheshire. The salt, however, is not uniform in
extent, but occupies limited areas.” The saliferous strata of Northwich
present the following series:</p>

<p>Droitwich, in Worcestershire, which is situated nearly in the
centre of the county, has been celebrated for the production of salt
from its brine-springs from the time of the Romans, who imposed a
tax on the Britons, who, it appears, worked the mines; and also
made salt a part of the pay of their soldiers’ <i>salarium</i>, or salary.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
Ever since, this inexhaustible fountain of saline water has continued
flowing up, and yielding salt in undiminished quantities. It is
very likely that the manufacture is coëval with the town itself; but
it was not till the year 1725 that the strong brine for which it is
now celebrated was discovered. From one spring, even, the enormous
amount of one thousand tons of salt are obtained every week.
At the depth of thirty or forty feet is a bed of hard gypsum,
about one hundred and fifty feet in thickness; through this a small
hole is bored to the stream of brine, which is about twenty-two
inches in depth, and beneath this is the rock-salt. The brine rising
quickly through the aperture is pumped into a capacious reservoir,
whence it is conveyed into iron boilers for evaporation. It is supposed
to be much stronger than any other in the kingdom, containing
above one-fourth part its weight of salt. “One of the
shafts is sunk to a depth of nearly five hundred feet, and passes
through four layers of salt, eighty-five feet in aggregate thickness.
Some of the beds of salt in Cheshire are from seventy to one
hundred and twenty feet in thickness;” and it is sometimes so hard
that it requires to be blasted with gunpowder.</p>

<p>In those districts where the marls of the Trias are covered by
other beds, and the salt-springs force their way through the superincumbent
deposits to the surface, these solutions of the chloride of
sodium undergo a chemical change, acquiring other properties, and
are then called mineral waters. The Cheltenham waters originate
thus.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Beneath the town of Cheltenham lie the Triassic deposits,
<span class="pagenum">34</span>the reservoir of the rock-salt and brine-springs, which generate the
mineral waters, and from which they derive their saline ingredients.
In their passage to the surface they go through various
modifications, by reason of the superincumbent beds of Lias, which
are impregnated with iron pyrites and the sulphate of lime.
From the analyses of these waters, it appears that their principal
constituents are the chloride of sodium (muriate of soda), or sea-salt,
and the sulphates of soda and magnesia. Sulphate of lime,
oxide of iron, and the chloride of magnesium are present in some
wells only, and in much smaller quantities. Besides these ingredients,
<i>iodine</i> and <i>bromine</i> have been detected by Dr. Daubeny, who
instituted experiments to ascertain whether these two active principles,
which the French chemists had recently discovered in
modern marine productions, did not exist in mineral waters issuing
from strata formed in the ancient seas. As the saline springs of the
red marls rise up through the Lias they undergo certain chemical
changes. From the decomposition of the sulphate of iron which takes
place, a vast quantity of sulphuric acid must be generated, which, reacting
on the different bases of magnesia, lime, etc., contained in the
strata, forms those sulphates so prevalent in the higher or pyritous
beds of the Lias; the oxide of iron being at the same time more or
less completely separated. By this means the mineral waters, which
are probably mere brine-springs at the greatest depths, acquire additional
medicinal qualities as they ascend to the places whence they
flow. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that fresh water
is continually falling from the atmosphere upon the surface of the
Lias clays, and percolating through the uppermost strata.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>The medicinal properties which are peculiar to these mineral
waters will be considered further on, when we come to discuss the
action of salt on the system, in health and disease, and the restorative
results which are due solely to its instrumentality.</p>

<p>The salt district is in the line which joins the Severn, the Dee, and
the Mersey, and doubtless once consisted of lakes flooded at every
tide, which, drying at certain seasons and at low tides, deposited
beds of salt, from Droitwich in Worcestershire, through Nantwich,
to the Mersey; brine-springs flowing over beds of salt, or rock-salt,
being found at different places on the entire line.</p>

<p>In the year 1863 a bed of rock-salt was discovered near the
mouth of the Tees, at Middlesborough, and also on the Durham
side of the river. The boring at Middlesborough showed that it
<span class="pagenum">35</span>was about 100 feet in thickness. Of late, borings have been made
near Port Clarence, on the Durham side, but with what result I am
not informed.</p>

<p>Scotland, as well as Ireland, is deficient in the more recent formation;
for salt, as well as chalk, does not occur. Both are entirely
absent; but geologists inform us that at one time chalk <i>did</i> exist,
judging from the presence of flints in considerable quantities in
Aberdeenshire, which they say affords unequivocal evidence of the
former presence of cretaceous strata now integrated; and they account
for it thus: the soft chalk being exposed to the action of the rain
and storms, has been gradually washed away, while the flints which
were embedded in it still remain. If this hypothesis is correct, that
at one time chalk existed and is now absent, we may by inference,
though we possess no evidence, presume that salt likewise, at some
period or other, was present in this part of the United Kingdom.
Chalk being entirely composed of the accumulation of marine
shells ground to impalpable powder, which has been gradually
consolidated, and being very rich in organic remains of shells,
star-fish, sponges, fishes, and lizards, must have been deposited by
sea-water, as its various ingredients indicate; therefore, during
its deposition, salt, if originating from sea-water, must of necessity
have left some marks characteristic of itself, in conjunction with
the chalk; both being, more or less, intimately connected with sea-water,
though the formation of one may not have been simultaneous
with the formation of the other.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>In our lately acquired “gem of the sea,” Cyprus, there have been
found extensive lakes of salt near Larnaca, the capital, so that this
liberally-abused island possesses at least something which may prove
of pecuniary value to its present owners. Being for several centuries
under the benighted rule of the Turk, this staple of commerce
has been entirely neglected, so as not to have been of the slightest
use to the inhabitants or to the greedy pachas.</p>

<p>In the south of Western Australia there are vast salt marshes
which only require to be worked so as to become the means of enriching
the colonists, and indirectly attracting emigrants to this
hitherto unprofitable portion of a dependency of England. The
principal, which is called Lake Austen, is 1400 feet above the level
of the sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">36</span></p>
<p>Salt is also to be found in our Indian Empire, in Rajpootana and
elsewhere, and is of considerable value to that country, especially
while it remains in the hands of the enterprising European;
according to Mr. Wynne, there is a salt range which extends from
Kalabagh to a point north of Tank. After acquainting us with its
geographical position, he says: “The coincidence between the physical
features and the geological structure of the ground is intimate,
the axial lines of the mountains carrying on the Salt Range feature
being also axes of anticlinals lying for the most part along the
scarped acclivities presented towards the Indus plains. These
plains are part of the great <i>quasi-desert</i> flat over which the Indus
has in past times capriciously wandered towards the Arabian Sea.
Whether they are due in any degree to marine explosion is uncertain,
though the sea may very possibly once have covered the low
ground in question. The ridges of the Salt Range, as they exist at
present, doubtless mark the same great later, or post-tertiary, period
of mountain-forming activity, in which originated not only the remainder
of the Salt Range, but also the Western Himalaya and the
Suliman and Afghan mountains.” When we come to consider the
geological bearings of salt, and its presumed origin, and other points
in connection with it, I shall again revert to this highly interesting
paper of Mr. Wynne’s.</p>

<p>In the Deccan, half-way between Bombay and Nagpur, there is a
very remarkable salt lake. It is a circular hollow, about one mile
across, and from 300 to 400 feet deep, having at the bottom a
shallow lake of salt water without any outlet. This hollow, I must
tell my reader, is ascribed by scientific men to a volcanic explosion.</p>

<p>There are so many lakes of salt, which are completely isolated
and so many miles from the sea, that it is next to impossible to
account for their existence if we do not ascribe them to volcanic
action. If they are situated in low-lying districts, we may justly
presume that at one time the sea must have been present, or
that the deposition must have resulted from occasional, or tidal,
overflow of salt water; but when they are many miles from the
coast, and many feet above or below the sea-level, then they may be
due to volcanic agency; and we shall find further on several other
salt lakes of variable depths or altitudes which would seem to corroborate
this hypothesis. The sea is undoubtedly a most formidable
agent in the disintegration of land, and often destroys whole tracts,
forcing its resistless waves into the interior of continents, and then,
owing to some unexplained cause, retiring to its original boundary.<span class="pagenum">37</span>
This may take centuries to complete, for revolutions effected by
nature are not accomplished speedily, unless there is some sudden
spasmodic upheaving, arising from earthquakes or storms. In 1282,
the isthmus uniting Friesland with the north of Holland was totally
destroyed by violent storms. In our own country a similar phenomenon
occurred in the year 1475, when a large tongue of land at the
mouth of the Humber was entirely broken up and carried away by
the sea. In 1510 an irruption of the Baltic formed the Frische-Haff,
an opening 6000 feet broad, and from twelve to fifteen fathoms in
depth. The eastern coast of England is continually receding, owing
to the encroachment of the sea. The rate of encroachment of the
sea at Owthorne, in Yorkshire, is reckoned at four yards in every
year, and several villages have been swallowed up by the ocean;
and in like manner the cliffs of Norfolk and Suffolk are suffering a
continual decay.</p>

<p>Though the sea is so destructive an element, it is also an agent in
the reproduction of land. The rocks and sand washed away from
one place are conveyed by tides and currents far into the sea, and
are deposited in strata, and then, in course of time, form shoals and
banks, which subsequently become promontories and islands. Alluvial
land has thus been formed, and in a similar way have many of
the stratified rocks been deposited; and as animals and plants have
been carried away and imbedded in the deposits of rivers, or floods,
so at some future period, though countless ages may elapse during
the process, will such animals and plants be discovered deposited
in these newer strata, just as we find organic remains in the older
rocks. The gradual deposition of strata has been the work of an incalculable
period of time, but the process may be traced every day in
the sections of marine estuaries and lakes. Owing to this continual
receding of the land in one part, and elevation of land in another,
there is an incessant change, from which, though occupying many
ages, and proceeding so slowly that it would be unobservable were
it not for accurate investigation, we may easily conjecture that
what is now land may at one time have been the bed of the ocean,
and where the sea now sweeps with overpowering fury, there may
once have been meadows and forests. The salt lakes, if not originating
from volcanic force, no doubt are the remains of the great
ocean, which, when it receded, left here and there, in what once
were luxuriant valleys, large reservoirs, indicating that in bygone
ages it had covered the land.</p>

<p>In Germany, Spain, Italy, Hungary, and Poland, there are exten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>sive
mines of rock-salt, and also in various other parts of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
There are also large mountains wholly composed of this fossil salt,
two of which are in those provinces of Russia known as Astrakhan
and Orenburg; and in the Crimea salt is said to be daily accumulating
in the inland lakes. In Asiatic Russia there are extensive
beds of salt, near Lake Indur, in lat. 48° 30´, long. 69°. The
Caspian Sea, called by the Turks “Cozgoun Denghizi,” “the sea of
crows and cormorants,” is “a great salt-water lake,” according to
Dr. William Smith, though Dr. Lemprière says that “its waters are
sweet.”</p>

<p>The most interesting salt-mine is that of Wieliczka, near Cracow,
in Galicia; it has been celebrated for centuries, and has been worked
for the last six hundred years. This wonderful mine is excavated
in a ridge of hills at the northern extremity of the chain which
joins the Carpathian mountains. When the stranger reaches the
mine there bursts upon his view a little world, the beauty of which
is scarcely to be imagined. He beholds a spacious plain containing
a kind of subterranean city, with houses, carriages, and roads, all
scooped out of one vast rock of salt, as bright and glittering as
crystal, while the blaze of the lights continually burning for the
general use is reflected from the dazzling columns which support
the lofty arched vaults of the mine, which are beautifully tinged
with all the colours of the rainbow, and sparkle with the lustre of
precious stones, affording a more splendid and fairy-like aspect than
anything above ground can possibly exhibit. In various parts of
this spacious plain stand the huts of the miners and their families,
some single, and others in clusters, like villages. They have very
little communication with the world above them, and many
hundreds of persons are born and pass the whole of their lives
here.</p>

<p>Through the midst of this plain lies a road which is always filled
with carriages laden with masses of salt from the furthest part of
the mine. The drivers are generally singing, and the salt looks
like a load of gems. A great number of horses are kept in the
mine, and, when once let down, never see daylight again.</p>

<p>Such is the marvellous salt-mine of Wieliczka, which is more
renowned on account of its magnitude, its age, and the weird and
<span class="pagenum">39</span>almost supernatural aspect it presents to the visitor, than any other.
Those subterranean palaces, with their magnificent appurtenances,
their fantastic occupants, and other dreams of the imaginative, are
not more strange or astonishing to the fascinated reader of romance
than this extraordinary, glistening, cavernous, mineral city, with its
numerous lamps, its crystallised walls, its roads, and the plaintive
songs of the drivers as they drive their horses through its sunless
thoroughfares, presents to the eyes of the surprised traveller.</p>

<p>There are valuable mines of salt in France, and in Greece, near
Missolonghi, but these have no special points of interest connected
with them.</p>

<p>In Abyssinia there are extensive and inexhaustible beds of salt,
which is used in quite a different way from what it is in other
countries, for little bars of it are circulated in place of small coin;
but it is only when it reaches the Amhara and Galla districts that
it becomes valuable.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>In other parts of the African continent there are large mountains
of rock-salt, and those of Tunis and Algiers are especially notable.</p>

<p>Salt is also to be found in Asia, in large mountains, in marshes,
and in lakes, to some of which I have already alluded. In the
north of Persia there is a large salt desert, and near Ispahan there
are quantities of rock-salt. The island of Ormuz, in the Persian
Gulf, almost consists of fossil salt; it is indeed so very plentiful
that the atmosphere is completely charged with it, so that the
dwellings of the inhabitants are encrusted with a tolerable thick
layer, giving them a peculiar glistening appearance; this phenomenon
is owing to the small particles of salt continually floating in the air
and rising from the ground, much in the same way as we see dew
deposited on the top of a garden wall or on a lawn after a hot
summer’s day.</p>

<p>We learn from Herodotus that there was a salt lake in Phrygia,
in Asia Minor. “Having so said, and fulfilled his promise, Xerxes
continued his route onwards. After passing by a city of Phrygia,
called Anaua, and a lake out of which salt is produced, he came
to Colossæ, a large city of Phrygia.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> I have previously alluded
to the Dead Sea and the interesting phenomena which it presents;
due south of it is the Valley of Salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">40</span></p>

<p>There are salt springs and springs from inflammable gas in China,
in long. 101° 29´, lat. 29°, near Thibet; and there is a large salt lake
possessing the strange name of Tsomoriri, many feet above the level
of the sea, in Western Thibet.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> “The Chinese bore well through
the rocks, and prepare the salt by firing the gas of others, so that
one heats 300 kettles by gas-fire.” The celestials, with their habitual
aptitude and industry, have obtained this salt for many centuries,
and simply by this ingenious method.</p>

<p>As a fact illustrating the value of salt in Siberia, I may as well
mention that in our own country a ton of salt is sold for fifteen
shillings, whilst on the Yenesei river as much as fifteen pounds is
given for the same quantity. The Muscovite we thus see is as acutely
alive to the beneficent results of a free use of salt as a dietetic, as
we English, and it would seem as if he were more so.</p>

<p>In some countries remote from the sea, which are devoid of
salt-mines, and where the water is not impregnated with it, the
inhabitants, aware of its usefulness, have a method of extracting
it from the ashes of vegetables. This fact would certainly seem to
indicate that salt has been used by various nations, as if mankind
had an intuitive knowledge of the benefits arising from the use of
salt, and that consequently, if there were no lakes containing it, or
mountains from which they could procure it, they were determined
to obtain it if even by artificial means.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the presence of salt in places distant
from the sea, I need only refer to the Great Salt Lake of Utah,
on the shores of which stand the Mormon city. Long before
the founder of the Latter Day Saints thought of establishing a
quasi-religious community, travellers who had the temerity to
wander over the wild prairies of the Oregon, the home of the
bison and the hunting-ground of the Indian, and who explored
the secrets of the then unknown land of the “Far West,” were
struck with amazement at the glistening aspect of the surface; for
in many places it was covered over with an impure kind of salt,
apparently a combination of <i>muriate and sulphate of soda</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> or more
<span class="pagenum">41</span>probably an impure form of the <i>chloride of sodium</i>. On tasting the
water which had collected in numerous little pools of no more than
a few inches in depth, they found it so bitter and pungent that it
acted on the mucous membrane almost as powerfully as a corrosive
poison. This large tract of country was at that time teeming
with life, for they daily saw vast herds of bisons, and frequently
came upon the hidden towns of the prairie-dog; in fact, wherever
they went, they either crossed the path of these wild denizens of
the plain, or else the sky was darkened by innumerable flocks of
birds. The district was wonderfully healthy, and totally free from
malaria or other causes generative of disease; the Indians, too, were
splendid specimens of humanity; they had not as yet been tainted
by too close a proximity with the so-called superior civilisation of
the white man, neither had they been so unfortunate as to have
fallen a prey to the vices and diseases which generally accompany
the humanising European.</p>

<p>On the pampas of La Plata, which is the treeless abode of the
wild horses of South America, there are several salt lakes, not
many miles distant from the river Quinto, and over these boundless
wastes thousands of wild cattle and horses gallop at pleasure, and
afford an inexhaustible stock of game for the lasso of the fearless
and expert Gaucho. Now it is a well-authenticated fact that those
diseases which are so destructive to the horses and cattle of Europe
are almost unknown in these regions. I do not mean to assert that
these salt lakes of La Plata account for the exemption which this
district enjoys from equine diseases; but there is no doubt that the
exhalations from them purify the atmosphere, and that their
influence extends for many miles because of the open nature of
the country. As a natural result, the whole region is constantly
kept in a healthy state; for air, charged with the chloride of
sodium, must of necessity act as a preventive to everything
inimical to health, and pure air we know (though how few really
know what that blessing is) is of a paramount importance in the
rearing of cattle. The foot-and-mouth disease, comparatively, has
never played such havoc as it does in Europe, and pneumonia,
which is almost intractable to treatment in this part of the world, and
which is frequently fatal when it is complicated with inflammation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>of the pleura, hardly ever appears in these parts, where stables
and farms are not far off from being rudimentary in construction,
and would appear to an English farmer, accustomed to the cosy-looking
farmsteads of his own country, very ill-calculated for
successful farming, and not at all adapted for bringing his cattle
and horses to perfection; yet it is just the reverse, for there is
no other part of South America so well fitted for the breeding of
cattle, and there is no other locality, whether in the Old or New
Worlds, so completely free from disease as the open pampas of La
Plata.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;"><a name="CV" id="CV">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">GEOLOGICAL FORMATION OF SALT.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Isaac Newton</span>, in his incomparable work upon Optics, likens
a particle of salt to a chaos, because of its “being dense, hard, dry,
earthy in the centre; and rare, soft and moist in the circumference.”
This ingenious definition is what one would expect from such an
observant and profound investigator; and I do not think that we
shall be able to find a better description of a salt-crystal than that
which this great philosopher has bequeathed us.</p>

<p>Regarding the original formation of rock-salt, there are many
opinions, theories and conjectures, and to the present day it is an
undecided question. We are, as I have previously stated, in complete
ignorance of the origin of the chloride of sodium; we must
consider it as one of those geological secrets upon which we shall
never be able to enlighten ourselves, if we cannot obtain stronger
evidence than that which we have at present. Science is at fault in
this, as she is in many other subjects which have perplexed and
interested from time to time those who study and seek to unravel
the various obscure and complicated phenomena of nature.</p>

<p>No satisfactory or elucidatory theory has, as yet, been advanced
to account for the occurrence of the formation of salt. Some
geologists have maintained that it was deposited from the ocean,
but in what way they do not explain; indeed, it is difficult to
suppose how it could have been so, for salt, or rather sea water,
holds in solution many ingredients which are not present in this
rock. Besides, the several strata above it contain organic remains, as
do also those below, though altogether of an entirely different kind;<span class="pagenum">43</span>
rock-salt itself contains none whatever; from this fact some have
inferred that the formation took place during the epoch which
elapsed between the destruction of one creation and the calling of
another into existence. Others suppose that it is simply the result
of volcanic action: this hypothesis is correct to a certain extent, as
far as isolated salt lakes like that of Tsomoriri in Western Thibet,
and that lake midway between Bombay and Nagpur, are concerned;
or those huge mountains consisting entirely of fossil salt, like the
one near Cardona, fifty miles from Barcelona, in Spain, or those
in Lahore, or in Peru; but it altogether fails as regards non-isolated
salt lakes and salt marshes, or such a large inland sea as the
Caspian. Some light may be thrown upon it by the recent explorations
in the North-Western Provinces of India, for Mr. Wynne
tells us that “the geological structure” (of the Indian Salt Range)
“of the trans-Indus extension of the Salt Range repeats in a great
measure that of the western portion of the Salt Range proper, but
with some considerable differences. The Palœozoic rocks, so far
as presented by the red-marl, rock-salt, and gypsum, are quite the
same, and so are the Carboniferous and Triassic groups, but others
of the sub-Carboniferous beds present themselves with a different
association from those of cis-Indus.” Mr. Wynne also informs us
that the mineral productions of the range are valuable, and consist
of the salt of Kalabagh and the Lun Nullah, the alum of Kalabagh
and the Chichali Pass, the coal or lignite from the Jurassic<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> beds
of the Kalabagh Hills: we also learn that gypsum is present with
the salt, as it is in Poland, Transylvania, and Hungary; for in these
three countries there is a layer of gypsum between the stratum of
stone and the bed of salt. This gypsiferous layer is of various
colours; it is crystallised, striated, and mixed with sea-shells: this
admixture would decidedly lead us to conclude that the salt was
originally deposited in bygone ages from the sea. On the contrary,
the salt in Cheshire is not accompanied by a bed of gypsum, there
are no vestiges of marine exuviæ, nor indeed any organic remains
to be detected in any of the strata.</p>

<p>If the formation of salt (I am referring to mountains of rock-salt
such as we see near Cordova, in Spain,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and salt-mines as we see
<span class="pagenum">44</span>in Galicia, and Cheshire, and also isolated salt lakes, like that
which exists in Western Thibet) is solely due to volcanic action,
or marine explosion, we may easily account for its irregular and
unequal distribution; also for its elevation into mountains, and
as beds beneath the surface of the earth, by reason of the greater or
less force which was employed for its upheaval; and also the thickness
or solidity of those strata of rocks through which it was
propelled in its upward course. If this were so, it is strange that
it should be entirely free from organic remains, whose absence
therefore is a formidable objection to this theory. Being accompanied
by gypsum in some districts and not in others, would
decidedly point to the presumed fact that salt has been the result
of some volcanic agency; for were it not so we should find, on the
contrary, owing to gradual formation, that gypsum would invariably
be present with it, in the same way as we find one stratum of rock
either above or below the stratum of another rock.</p>

<p>From the fact that deposits of salt are not confined to any particular
group of strata—for while the salt-mines of Galicia belong
to the tertiary formations, those in the State of New York are
found in the middle of the Silurian system—we may say that
salt is not subject to geological laws by reason of its somewhat
erratic appearances in different strata. As the chlorides of sodium
and gypsum are frequently sublimed from volcanic vents, an igneous
origin has been ascribed to many of the beds of salt and gypsum;
and Mr. Bakewell threw out the suggestion that the consolidation
of both salt and gypsum must have been effected by heat, because
the great deposit of gypsum that occurs with rock-salt at Bex, in
Switzerland, was found by M. Carpentier to be anhydrous when
exposed to the atmosphere. If this hypothesis is correct, and if
salt and gypsum<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> were at some period in a state of fusion, it is
difficult to believe that when consolidated they are so perfectly
distinct and in two different strata, so that one contains organic
remains, whilst the other is altogether free from the slightest
<span class="pagenum">45</span>vestige. It may have been possible that one was in a state of
fusion when the other was consolidated, and different degrees of
heat might have been necessary for the purpose.</p>

<p>We also may account for the absence of organic remains in rock-salt
to the following cause: the chloride of sodium, when in a
state of fusion, might have possessed the property of disintegrating,
dissolving, and absorbing within itself, however minute they might
be, all particles of organic matter with which it came into contact.
Dr. Mantell writes: “It cannot, however, be with certainty determined
whether the absence or paucity of fossils in a deposit is
owing to the actual reduction of the amount of life in the seas of
a given area, or to the mineral character of the strata not having
been favourable to the preservation of organic remains.”</p>

<p>A very serious difficulty presents itself in the great thickness of
many strata of salt; which, if regarded as the solid residuum of
sea-water, must have necessarily required a proportionate volume
of water, unless the seas of those distant periods contained a larger
amount of saline ingredients than they do at the present time: an
inference for which there are no reasonable grounds.</p>

<p>Wherever there are deposits of the chloride of sodium, they are
almost always accompanied with layers and intercalations of gypsum;
and the peculiar circumstance of two powerful acids, the sulphuric
(in the gypsum, or sulphate of lime), and the muriatic or hydrochloric
(in the chloride of sodium), being so abundantly and uniformly
present, seems to point to a common origin; both are
productions of volcanic agency, though of the two I think salt
frequently owes its origin more to the subterranean activity than the
gypsum, because we find there are beds of salt where there is no
gypsum, and isolated salt lakes which might have been elevated
into mountains had the process, during their production, been of
the same force as that used in the formation of rock-salt, owing to
an unexplainable interruption and premature desinence.</p>

<p>The relation between the formation of gypsum and volcanic
action seems to be borne out by the fact that in North America,
where the coal measures are not associated with rocks resulting
from volcanic agency, there are no gypsum-beds; while on the contrary,
there are large deposits of gypsum, where igneous rocks are
interpolated beneath the stratum of coal, in Nova Scotia.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Sir Charles Lyell, after a careful inquiry into the phenomena
<span class="pagenum">46</span>exhibited by these strata of gypsum, gives his opinion that the
production of these gypsiferous beds in the carboniferous sea was
closely connected with volcanic agency, whether in the form of
heated vapours or stufas, or of hot mineral springs, or some other
effects resulting from submarine igneous irruptions.</p>

<p>Salt or brine springs occur in various parts of the United States
in the <i>old transition slate</i> rocks. Sir Charles Lyell tells us that,
“in the middle of the horizontal Silurian rocks, in the State
of New York, there is a formation of red, green, and blueish-grey
marls, with beds of gypsum, and occasional salt-springs, the whole
being from 800 to 1000 feet, and indistinguishable in mineral
character from parts of the Trias of Europe.” Salt-springs also
occur in England in the coal measures. The rock-salt of Cheshire
and the brine-springs of Worcestershire occur in what is called
the <i>old red sandstone</i> group. The salt of Ischl, in the Austrian
Alps, belongs to the <i>oolitic</i>, as does also that found in the Lias of
Switzerland. The immense mass or bed of salt near Cordova
occurs in the <i>cretaceous</i> group; while the salt deposit of Wieliczka
belongs to the <i>supracretaceous</i> group.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>The reader doubtless remembers, as I stated in the first chapter,
that the origin of salt is one of those enigmas of nature which, as
yet, has completely frustrated the most accomplished and scientific
geologists, and no suggestion has yet been made which will satisfactorily
and conclusively account for its formation; for whatever
hypothesis has been stated, there is sure to be an objection so difficult
to overcome, that the author has been fain to admit that it is
thoroughly impracticable, and therefore inadmissible. That it is
decidedly not amenable to the received laws of geology, is apparent,
which all must admit; therefore one cannot possibly apply them so
as to determine the place it occupies in relation to other strata, or
practically fix that period of time in which it was deposited; for
it is erratic, and its position is anomalous—erratic in the variety
of appearances it assumes in creation, and anomalous because it
belongs to no particular strata, and therefore no exact period of
time can be assigned to it as to other formations.</p>

<p>That salt is either due to volcanic agency, marine explosion, or
to overflow of sea-water and subsequent evaporation, or resilience,
and ultimate deposition, are the only three hypotheses which can
with any credibility be advanced to account for its formation.</p>

<p>That we have it presented to us in <i>six</i> different conformations
<span class="pagenum">47</span>are facts which when considered separately seem to point to one
common origin, but when taken as a whole indicate a separate
inception.</p>

<p>Is it due to volcanic agency? In some respects it undoubtedly
is, otherwise how can we reasonably account for those gigantic
mountains of fossil or rock salt, which rise up isolated in the midst
of a country perfectly free for miles round of saline deposits, which
present not even the slightest trace of it? How can we account
for it by any other means when we find it in intimate relation
with gypsum, which we know is solely the production of subterranean
activity? What reason can we possibly assign for those
salt lakes which are above or below the sea-level and are perfectly
solitary, and which have no communication with the sea or with
rivers, if they are not phenomena resulting from volcanic agency?
And how can we account for those masses of salt below the earth’s
surface which in some countries is of such adamantine hardness
that it requires to be blasted with gunpowder, if it is not the production
of volcanic force? If so, why is it that no remains of
organic matter are found imbedded in it? How comes it, if it is the
result of subterranean agency, that organic remains are found in the
gypsum and none in the salt, when both are caused by volcanic
explosion? Thus we see the theory of volcanic explosion is met
with a most formidable objection.</p>

<p>If marine explosion is the sole cause of the formation of salt,
and if the sea has through rents and crevices of the earth forced
up its superabundant saline constituents wherever there has been
a vent for their egress, and which has in the course of time become
condensed owing to the evaporation of the water or through its
percolating into the lower strata, another difficulty crops up quite
as unanswerable seemingly as that which stands in the way of the
volcanic hypothesis: there are no remains of marine organisms to
be found, nor are there any traces of vegetable matter.</p>

<p>The overflow and evaporation of sea-water and the subsequent
deposition of salt holds good in certain respects as regards salt lakes
and salt marshes when they are in close proximity or in the same
locality; but then those other inorganic constituents which are
found as a general rule in sea-water are not present in those open
reservoirs, which is a difficulty as formidable as the others, and
admits of no evasion.</p>

<p>These are the three hypotheses with their obstacles; the hypotheses
feasible, the obstacles apparently unanswerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">48</span></p>

<p>We have salt, or the chloride of sodium, presented to us in six
different conditions, viz.: <i>sea or salt water, salt or brine springs, salt lakes, salt mines, mountain or fossil or rock salt, and salt marshes</i>.
The characteristics of salt are just the same fundamentally, whether
we extract it by evaporation from sea-water or salt lakes; whether
we obtain it from salt-springs; whether we dig it out of the earth or
by the excavation of salt mountains; or whether we acquire it from
salt marshes: there is no alteration in its ingredients, though it
may be impure from the admixture of arsenic or the sulphates of
soda and magnesia, or other impurities, or it may be discoloured
red by the oxide of iron derived from decomposed trap-rocks; still,
for all that, the chloride of sodium remains intact. The properties
of salt are not subject to the slightest change or modification: the
acid is the hydrochloric or muriatic, the base sodium, and the combination,
the chloride of sodium.</p>

<p>We find salt, or the chloride of sodium, in sea-water, the amount
averaging from 4 to 5·7 per cent., so that we see it is present in no
inconsiderable quantity; it is more or less impure from other salts
being held in solution in conjunction: where it comes from no
suggestion has yet been broached. We know that it is present,
and we also know that it can be obtained by adopting certain
measures for extracting it; and we are aware, from recent investigations,
that the colour and density of the sea is dependent on
the quantity held in solution. This is all we really know regarding
the presence of the chloride of sodium in the ocean.</p>

<p>The salt which we obtain from brine-springs contains the same
constituents as that which we extract from the sea, though in their
course upwards they collect on their way soluble salts, and therefore
the water goes through certain modifications, which the reader
doubtless recollects. For instance, the brine-springs of Lancashire
and Worcestershire rise up through strata of sandstone and red
marl, which contain large beds of rock-salt. The origin of the
brine, therefore, may be derived from beds of fossil-salt; but as
the muriate of soda is one of the products in volcanic regions, the
original source of salt may be as deep as that of lava.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>We have also seen that the base of all mineral waters is the
chloride of sodium, and that their ingredients are collected and
dissolved as they ascend to the surface; therefore they may probably
both have the same origin as the sea, as regards the chloride
of sodium, which they both hold in solution. We can account for
<span class="pagenum">49</span>their other characteristics by the wide expansiveness of the sea,
which is perpetually absorbing and emitting vapours, and by the
several strata through which the mineral waters pass. There may
be, though there is nothing that we can advance as corroborative,
a subterranean communication existing between them, which would
imply a common origin, the differences arising from the physical
surroundings, atmospheric influences, and the absorption of soluble
salts from the several strata.</p>

<p>What is the origin of salt lakes and salt marshes? This is, to a
certain extent, more easily explained. One theory as to the origin
of salt lakes (we naturally include inland seas, such as the Caspian
and the Aral) is the overflow and subsequent retirement of the sea-water,
their sites having been originally the bed of the ocean when
it receded to its present limits, leaving in its course depressions
of land, volumes of water of various depths, elevations, and
extent of surface, according to their deepness, altitude, or angles of
declivity.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Other ingenious hypotheses have been broached, which,
I need hardly say, are not worth considering, as they are entirely
visionary. In the case of isolated salt lakes, the above theory is
not applicable; and geologists tell us that they are doubtless the
result of volcanic agency, but at what period of time it is impossible
to estimate, for the density of the water found in them
is not equable, and neither is their specific gravity the same as
that of sea-water, nor are there any remains of marine organisms;
and as their depth is variable, they are not confined to any particular
strata.</p>

<p>I have hinted previously that these isolated salt lakes are (if I
may venture to designate them as such) geological abortions. Had
the power which forced them into their present situation been
accompanied by that agency which has raised such huge masses as
those near Cordova, in Spain, and by the Dead Sea, and which
probably brought about their present crystalline form, others by
reason of some unexplainable and gradual transition, by chemical
means, or decrease of temperature, which naturally would occur
the nearer it approached the earth’s surface, these lakes might
have developed into beds or mountains of salt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">50</span></p>
<p>The salt which is dug out of the earth, and that which is excavated
out of isolated salt-mountains, are alike in every respect, and
are much more probably the result of volcanic explosion than of
the deposition of salt from sea-water, accruing from evaporation
while pent up in confined spaces. It may have been, though incalculable
ages ago, deposited from the sea, and then in course of
time forced up while in a state of fusion by some internal disruption.</p>

<p>We thus see that the six conditions under which we find the
chloride of sodium more or less indicate a common origin from sea-water,
notwithstanding the absence of marine organisms.</p>

<p>If we take salt as a whole, leaving out of the question altogether
the different conditions in which it is found, and with no reference
at all to its existing either in the earth, above the earth, in lakes, or
in the sea, but looking at it simply as it is, a mass of rock, or a
volume of water holding it in solution, it inclines one to the belief
that it possesses a dual inchoation, though the original source of
both may have been connate; but owing to extraneous causes
which were brought to bear, one branch became crystallised rock-salt,
while the other, through immaturity, remains in a state of
solution. One is rock-salt, which has been heaved up by volcanic
power, and the other is what is known as sea-water; the former
has produced the mines, and the solitary mountains, and the
Indian Salt Range, and that salt which generates mineral waters,
and, it may be, those saline lakes like that which exists between
Bombay and Nagpur.</p>

<p>According to Sir Charles Lyell, sea-water has access to volcanic
foci. He says: “Although the theory which assumes that water
plays a principal part in volcanic operations does not necessarily
imply the proximity of volcanic vents to the ocean, it seems still
to follow naturally that the superficial outbursts of steam and
lava will be most prevalent where there is an incumbent body of
salt water, or any regions rather than in the interior of a continent,
where the quantity of rain-water is reduced to a minimum.
The experiments of the most eminent chemists have gradually removed,
one after another, the objections which were first offered
to the doctrine that the salt water of the sea plays a leading
part in most volcanic eruptions. Sir Humphry Davy observed
that the fumes which escaped from Vesuvian lava deposited
common salt.”</p>

<p>All the principal volcanoes are situated close to the sea, and<span class="pagenum">51</span>
therefore the hypothesis that a communication exists between them
is practically certain; their proximity to the sea, and the deposition
of salt from the fumes of lava, as Sir Humphry Davy noticed,
are two strong facts. But for all that, it does not prove satisfactorily
that salt is solely the result of volcanic agency, and indirectly
from the sea, because there is not the slightest trace of the
remains of marine organisms, unless they are totally destroyed
and obliterated when it is in a state of fusion; if so, it is more
conclusive that salt such as we find it is solely due to volcanic
force. Salt may have been in times past, as the observations of
Sir Humphry Davy seem to corroborate, and as confirmed by
more recent chemists, deposited by volcanic agency in the same way
that salt is deposited by fumes of hydrochloric acid, which are
emitted with the lava during eruptions of such volcanoes as Vesuvius
and Etna, by reason of some communication with the sea.</p>

<p>As hydrochloric acid is found in the vapours which are disengaged
from red-hot lava, and as magnesia, which is not volatile, is
left in the lava itself, constituting one of its most important elements,
it would certainly lead one to surmise that there is a communication
which, though not always in existence, may be periodically
caused by the action of the volcano.</p>

<p>Both MM. St. Claire Deville and Fouqué have succeeded
in demonstrating the perfect accordance of the chemical composition
of the products of volcanic eruptions, both gaseous and solid,
with the doctrine that salt water has been largely present in volcanic
foci. If so, why are there no salts of magnesia in volcanic
fumeroles? These salts are readily decomposable by hot steam,
and when water and heat are present they produce hydrochloric
acid and magnesia. M. Fouqué affirmed that he witnessed an
eruption of Mount Etna in 1865; the gaseous emanations agreed
in kind with those which we might have looked for if large volumes
of sea-water had gained access to reservoirs of subterranean lava,
and if they had been decomposed and expelled with the lava.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
We have obtained three facts, viz., that communications probably
exist between volcanic foci and sea-water; that fumes of hydrochloric
acid which accompany the lava deposit common salt; and
that the salts of magnesia are decomposed by heat; and what more
probable than that all living organisms which pass with the sea-water
are utterly obliterated?</p>

<p>By the preceding observations, the reader will see that salt is not
<span class="pagenum">52</span>subject to geological laws, by reason of its being confined to no
particular strata, and by the absence of organic remains; and that
it is not derived from sea-water, because there are no marine organisms
to be found in it.</p>

<p>That though it may have a pristine source, it has (though it may
appear paradoxical) a dual inchoation—by its being found as
rock-salt, and by its being present in sea-water, and, as I have
stated, in a condition of immaturity.</p>

<p>Rock-salt appears to be the result of volcanic agency, from its
being almost invariably (with but few exceptions) in juxtaposition
with gypsum, which is known to be of volcanic origin; by its
being found forced up independently of other formations, even
through the crust of the earth; by the presence of fumes of hydrochloric
acid with lava during volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>It has undoubtedly an igneous origin, and the entire absence of
organic remains may be accounted for by the fact that while in a
state of fusion it may have disintegrated, absorbed into itself, or
altogether obliterated all remains of living organisms with which it
may have come into immediate contact. All other formations have
preserved the impress and structure of vegetable and animal life;
salt is the sole exception to the rule; and if while in a state of
fusion it possessed the property of destroying and obliterating all
marks of animal and vegetable remains, we can easily account for
their absence.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>We have also seen that sea-water has access to volcanic foci, by
reason of fumes of hydrochloric acid, which deposit common salt,
and by the proximity of the volcanoes to the sea.</p>

<p>One question is naturally evolved out of this: does the sea
obtain its saline constituents from vast reservoirs, or beds of salt,
through the medium of communication with volcanic foci?</p>

<p>This question I leave unsolved, for were we to discuss it, we
should probably have to enter into other matters which would be
somewhat foreign to my subject. My opinion is that sea-water (if
my hypothesis that it is nothing else than salt in a state of immaturity
is correct) obtains its chloride of sodium in this way; and,
if so, it accounts at once for the absence of marine organisms, upon
which phenomenon geologists have always laid so much stress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Besides, if salt is derived from evaporation of sea-water, and subsequent
deposition of salt, we should be able to obtain remains of
marine organisms, if not those of land animals. This one fact
alone would tend to prove that sea-water is the result of some subterranean
communication with reservoirs of salt, through the media
of volcanic foci.</p>

<p>We have thus before us certain geological facts relative to salt,
which show that though it has not been discovered in the old stratified
rocks, it is nevertheless met with in nearly all the later formations,
and also that it is in process of formation, and notably so in
the Crimea. This undoubtedly is the case; but still we cannot
apply any of the laws of geology so as to make our conjectures
confirmative by certain facts which support one hypothesis and
overthrow another.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;"><a name="CVI" id="CVI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">EFFECTS ON ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> salt is one of the principal constituents of the blood, and as it
is present in the various tissues of the body, and as its ingestion is
necessary for the animal economy, for the maintenance of its health,
and consequently for the due development of the several organs,
and the invigorating effects it exerts over their functional activity,
we will now consider it in the relation it holds to animal and vegetable
life.</p>

<p>By the great majority of land animals salt is evidently an article
much relished, for in those districts where salt springs and lakes are
prevalent, many quadrupeds and birds are invariably to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
They frequent these spots in great numbers, and very seldom migrate
to those districts which are deficient in salt, or, if they do, very
speedily return; these animal instincts are indicative that they are
aware of its bracing qualities, and experience the salubriousness of
the atmosphere, which naturally is impregnated with a fair amount
of salt, which has risen through the media of exhalations from the
water or evaporation of the same.</p>

<p>In the Ruminantia the beneficial and, indeed, the salutary action
of salt is remarkably observable, for it counteracts in this class of
animals the deleterious effects of rainy weather, damp pasturage,
<span class="pagenum">54</span>and damaged fodder. It also imparts a consistency to the fat, and
renders the meat more palatable and wholesome. All cattle, without
an exception, thrive best if they are supplied with salt; and
they will consume no small quantity. Horses will, on the average,
consume daily six ounces; cows, four ounces, and will, it is said,
secrete a larger quantity of milk, and of a much richer quality, than
those from which salt is usually withheld. Sheep will consume
half an ounce daily, and they are not affected with the rot, as is so
frequently the case in low-lying marshy districts where they drink
water in which there are myriads of the fluke-worm, embryonic and
developed, especially after heavy rains or inundations, as, for instance,
a river overflowing its banks. It is a fact which farmers
and graziers should by no means lose sight of, that these worms are
totally destroyed by giving sheep a certain amount of salt during
moist and wet seasons, and in those localities which are generally in
a state of humidity.</p>

<p>In marine animals common salt is a necessary constituent of their
drink, and in fact it is the preserver of their life; but it is injurious,
if not certain destruction, to many fresh-water fish, though some
live both in the sea and fresh water—as the salmon, sturgeon, and
some species of lamprey. The male salmon, on entering the
mouths of rivers in order to spawn, follow the females, and fecundate
the ova which they have deposited in little pools, or kinds of
nests. They, therefore, are hatched in rivers. After the first year
they remove to the sea, and, remaining in it for about two months
to ten weeks, return to fresh water. Such is the alternate fresh and
salt-water life of the salmon, showing us that some fish can live in
the sea and breed in fresh water.</p>

<p>Reptiles and animals of an inferior class are deprived of life by
the action of salt water; and such organisms as the amœba, hydra,
rotifer, and others of a similar grade which we see in stagnant
ponds, are speedily killed if put into water in which salt is dissolved;
this is also the case with earth-worms, snails, and indeed
all insects as a general rule, especially if generated by animal and
vegetable decay.</p>

<p>Owing to the antagonism of salt to life produced by putrefaction,
it is frequently rubbed into meat to prevent it from being attacked
by putrescent larvæ; and even if decomposition has commenced, it
arrests for a long time its further progress. We all know what an
intense irritant it is to leeches, and how they immediately vomit if
some salt is sprinkled upon them when they are engorged with blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">55</span></p>

<p>Land shells are rapidly killed by sea-water, and so are their eggs;
this fact has been demonstrated by Darwin, who says: “Their eggs,
at least such as I have tried, sink into it and are killed.” From
experiments performed by Baron Aucapitaine, we find the above
corroborated. He placed in a box, pierced with holes, one hundred
land shells belonging to ten different species, and then immersed it
in sea-water for a fortnight; <i>only</i> twenty-seven recovered.</p>

<p>These experiments are conclusive, and prove that salt destroys life
of an inferior grade, probably owing to the fact that, generally, it is
calculated to produce results of a nature somewhat disposed to
become an annoyance, or even inimical to the vitalisation of superior
organisms, and tends to arrest their progress and due development.
We must remember that these two experiments of Mr. Darwin and
Baron Aucapitaine were with sea-water, consequently the other
salts which it holds in solution (the sulphates of soda and magnesia),
and the organic matter which it contains, very probably
hastened the progress.</p>

<p>The Batrachians, a class of animals allied to the reptiles, but
undergoing a peculiar metamorphosis, have an antipathy to salt,
and consequently cannot live in salt water; it is death to them
sooner or later.</p>

<p>We cannot say that reptiles, as a rule, frequent fresh water in
preference to salt, some being found only in sea-water, and in
those parts of the ocean where there is a greater quantity of
saline matter than in others. There is the marine Chelonia,
for instance, commonly known as turtles (Chelones); one sub-group,
the common green turtle, so well known for its
palatable qualities, is composed of species altogether herbivorous,
and of gregarious and innocent habits, “These animals may be
seen in herds at the bottom of the sea, quietly browsing on the
weeds growing there. Sometimes they enter the mouths of large
rivers, and are occasionally seen to make their way ashore, apparently
in search of food.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Like the salmon, it is a habitat of both
fresh and sea water, though under different conditions; one frequents
fresh-water for food, the other for breeding. Another sub-group
comprises turtles of carnivorous habits, active, and, when attacked,
fierce; such is the loggerhead turtle and the hawksbill; the latter
is the animal which furnishes the arts with the elegant substance
called tortoise-shell. There is also a genus of carnivorous habits,
called the Sphargis, or coriaceous turtle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">56</span></p>
<p>There are likewise the river tortoises (Tryonices), which are conspicuous
tenants of the Ganges, the Euphrates, the Niger, the Nile,
the Mississippi, and the Ohio. These reptiles are next in size to
the turtles, some being three feet long; they are very fierce, and
do not even scruple to attack the young alligators. They live
principally on fresh-water fish and small reptiles; sometimes they
will venture into sea-water in quest of food, though not far, as we
may suppose. There are also the Emydes, which are sometimes
called fresh-water tortoises, sometimes marsh tortoises, which are of
many different species. They haunt lakes, marshes, and small
rivers in Asia, Africa, and Australia, but more particularly America,
where the proper habitat is represented. In the North American
rivers there is found the Emysaura serpentina, which has a large
head and crocodilian tail; it feeds on fishes and small birds.
Another species, called Chelys fimbriata, or Matamata, belongs exclusively
to the rivers of Guiana.</p>

<p>We thus see that the Chelonia, which are remarkable for the box-like
case in which most of them are enclosed, are inhabitants of the
sea, while their near relations, the tortoises, are only partially
aquatic in their habits.</p>

<p>Reptiles are therefore neither land, sea-water, nor fresh-water
animals, if we view them as a whole; but if we divide them into
orders, we shall be able to see at once which are fresh-water, which
are terrestrial, and which are inhabitants proper of the sea. Firstly,
there is the Amphibia (doubled-lived), which live and breed in
fresh water, such as rivers, lakes, ponds, and ditches, and which are
killed if put into salt water. Secondly, there is the Ophidia (snake-like
order), which are peculiar to the land, though there is a fresh-water
snake in the East Indies, and which the natives will boldly
attack with sticks. The Sauria (lizards) next claim our attention.
The alligator is a native of North America, and is very abundant in
the Mississippi. It is very seldom seen near the mouths of rivers,
and in winter it buries itself in the mud, and continues in a torpid
state till spring. Then there are the crocodiles, which are natives
of Africa, the West Indies, and America. Their habits are somewhat
similar to those of the alligator, frequenting the creeks of
rivers by night in search of food; they are sometimes seen near the
mouths of rivers, but not as a rule. We have already remarked
upon the Testudinata, or the turtle kind.</p>

<p>Reptiles, therefore, either frequent the land or the water; some
are purely aquatic, others purely terrestrial, the remainder are both;<span class="pagenum">57</span>
one order is altogether marine, though frequently they are seen on
shore, where they are caught.</p>

<p>Salt water is death to one order, but affords the means of life to
another; to yet another order, with but few exceptions, both salt and
fresh water are deleterious, and, in fact, death; whilst still another
order frequents both elements, just as the chances of obtaining food
may direct them.</p>

<p>Such animals as the hippopotamus, the rhinoceros, the tapir, and
the elephant, and a few others belonging to the Pachydermata, frequent
the banks of rivers and fresh-water lakes, where they wallow
in the mud, and now and then, as fancy takes them, splash about
in the water; but they, like the crocodile, have never been known,
as far as I can gather, to make for salt water, and therefore they
are seldom, if ever, seen near the mouths of rivers, or by the coast.</p>

<p>Salt is therefore not avoided, almost as a rule, either by animals
or birds; and in those districts where salt lakes are situated (to
which interesting fact I have already alluded) are to be invariably
seen, not only great numbers of animals, but large flocks
of birds of different kinds, showing conclusively that they possess
an instinctive preference for those localities where the atmosphere
is more or less filled with saline matter, than for those places
where it is entirely absent. It is but seldom that animals frequent
those spots which are injurious to them; they take good care to
avoid them, if possible, and if they detect anything deleterious,
whether it be in the air, soil, or water, they migrate to more genial
quarters; instinct indicates this necessity, and they accordingly
act upon it. It is strange that mere animal instinct should be
superior to human reason, and that animal sagacity should be more
far-seeing than human forethought! Nothing is more strongly
confirmative of this anomaly, if I may call it so, than the partiality
which animals entertain for those districts which abound with
salt lakes, and the antipathy, or utter indifference, with which
some people regard that substance which keeps the body pure,
healthy, and, I may say, clean, and which plays such a highly-important
part in the animal economy.</p>

<p>In the vegetable kingdom salt is by no means an inconsiderable
item, and as an agricultural agent it is most invaluable, though its
operation therein varies in a remarkable degree; in small quantities
it is injurious only to a few plants, while to some it appears to be
beneficial in every way. In moderation it is an excellent manure,
especially if the soil is of a sandy nature; but in large quantities<span class="pagenum">58</span>
it is decidedly pernicious to all plants, without an exception, though
unequally so. According to experiments made by Dr. Balfour and
other eminent botanists, it appears that a solution of the chloride
of sodium does not act so deleteriously as solutions of other inorganic
substances, and the same effect is observable with a solution
of the phosphate of soda: the strength of these solutions, we are
told, varied from half a grain to five grains to the ounce of water;
the sodium combined with the chlorine forming the chloride of
sodium, and with the oxygen forming soda; the potassium, combined
with the chlorine, forming the chloride of potassium, and
with the oxygen forming potassa. The combinations take place,
according to Johnston, in the living plants owing to the natural
affinities of these inorganic substances.</p>

<p>Darwin writes: “In botanical works, this or that plant is often
stated to be ill-adapted for wide dissemination, but the greater or
less facilities for transport across the sea may be said to be almost
wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley’s aid, a few
experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the
injurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I found that out of
87 kinds, 64 germinated after an immersion of 28 days, and a few
survived an immersion of 137 days. It deserves notice that certain
orders were far more injured than others; nine Leguminosæ were
tried, and, with one exception, they resisted the salt-water badly;
seven species of the allied orders, Hydrophyllaceæ and Polemoniaceæ,
were all killed by a month’s immersion. For convenience’ sake,
I chiefly tried small seeds, without the capsules or fruit; and as all
these sank in a few days, they could not have been floated across
wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured by the
salt-water. Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, etc.,
and some of these floated for a long time. It is well known what
a difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber;
and it occurred to me that floods would often wash into the sea
dried plants or branches with seed capsules or fruit attached to
them. Hence I was led to dry the stems and branches of 94 plants
with ripe fruit, and to place them on sea-water. The majority sank
quickly, but some which, whilst green, floated for a very short time,
when dried floated much longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank
immediately, but when dried they floated for 90 days, and afterwards
when planted germinated; an asparagus-plant with ripe
berries floated for 23 days, when dried it floated for 85 days, and
the seeds afterwards germinated; the ripe seeds of Helosciadium<span class="pagenum">59</span>
sank in 2 days, when dried they floated for above 90 days, and
afterwards germinated. Altogether, out of the 94 dried plants, 18
floated for above 28 days; and some of the 18 floated for a very
much longer period. So that as 64/87 kinds of seeds germinated after
an immersion of 28 days; and as 18/94 distinct species with ripe fruit
(but not all the same species, as in the foregoing experiment) floated,
after being dried, for above 28 days, we may conclude, as far as
anything can be inferred from these scanty facts, that the seeds of
14/100 kinds of plants of any country might be floated by sea-currents
during 28 days and would retain their power of germination.”</p>

<p>We have thus sufficient evidence before us to prove that salt or
sea water does not totally destroy the vitality of seeds when they
are in a dry state, that some of them will float for 90 days, and
when planted subsequently will germinate; but that when not dry
they will sink immediately. We may, therefore, justly conclude
from the result of these experiments that salt is not noxious to
vegetable life, neither does it destroy the latent principle of procreation
which exists in them; and that though the process of germination
may be retarded, and kept in a state of abeyance, it is not
virtually annihilated, as one would feel inclined to predict, by the
prolonged immersion of seeds in salt-water, be they dried or fresh.</p>

<p>Darwin’s experiments were afterwards verified, for he states that
subsequently M. Martens tried “similar ones, but in a much better
manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so that
they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating
plants. He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose
many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near
the sea; and this would have favoured both the average length of
their flotation, and their resistance to the injurious action of the
salt water. On the other hand, he did not previously dry the plants
or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have
caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was
that 18/98 of his seeds of different kinds floated for 42 days, and were
then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed
to the waves would float for a less time than those protected
from violent movement as in our experiments. Therefore it would,
perhaps, be safe to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 parts of a
flora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of 900
miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger
fruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants
with large seeds or fruit which, as Alph. de Candolle has shown,<span class="pagenum">60</span>
generally have restricted ranges, could hardly be transported by
other means.”</p>

<p>Darwin’s experiments show us that salt or sea water does not
entirely extirpate the life which is dormant in seeds, and those of
Martens prove that seeds may be immersed in sea-water itself and
yet retain the power of germination; and that when dry they may
even float for 900 miles, and germinate when planted; developing
into plants at the usual period of time allotted by nature!</p>

<p>In Cheshire it is a custom to let out the water of the salt-springs
after rain, in order to improve the character of the soil and make
it more productive. If we call to mind the preservative properties
of salt and the purifying action which it possesses, with regard to
animal and vegetable substances, we need not at all be surprised
at the above use to which it is put by the agriculturists of Cheshire.
The reader, perhaps, would like to know why it is used after rain.
After a heavy shower, and more especially in the country, every
insect leaves its little secluded habitation: the bee is once more on
the wing; the spider resumes his usual central position in his web;
flies of all sizes buzz here and there in search of food or for more
secure homes; every bush is alive with its usual occupants; the
lofty tree is once more the tenement of song; the caterpillar crawls
on his solitary way; the ant trudges along on the gravel-path; the
snail emerges from his retreat and plods slowly to another home;
and the earth-worm raises itself on the lawn; all with one accord
hail the reappearance of sunshine, and show signs, however feeble,
of joy that the rain-cloud has passed and that the landscape has
resumed its beauties, and the sky its gold and azure. The earth
after rain, and particularly in spring and summer, teems with
almost reanimated life, both with that which is harmless and with
that which is hurtful, so that the Cheshire custom is one which
cannot be too highly recommended, for when the soil is saturated
with moisture, a soluble salt like the chloride of sodium, already
in a state of solution, sinks in more rapidly, and permeates it more
thoroughly than if it were merely sprinkled over the surface; and
such insects as are associated with or which live in the earth are
speedily eliminated, or are forced to seek shelter at a greater depth,
where they ultimately die by reason of their inability to obtain
their proper sustenance or the unsuitableness of their new
abode.</p>

<p>There is a plant called Halimodendron which only grows in the
dry, naked salt-fields by the river Irtysh, in Siberia; it is a genus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
of the Leguminosæ, and has purple flowers. Saltwort, or Salsola,
(<i>salsus</i>, salt) is chiefly maritime, and the kelp of our shores is
principally obtained from it. At one time the carbonate of soda
was derived from this kelp or barilla, the ashes being obtained from
burning sea-weeds and a species of Salsola; but now it is almost
invariably made from common salt, by adding sulphuric acid, and
so converting the chloride of sodium into a sulphate, and afterwards,
by combustion with chalk and small coal, resolving it into a
sulphide, and then into a carbonate. It is manufactured on a very
large scale, and is an important staple of commerce. From it is
obtained a most important drug, the bicarbonate of soda, the
efficacy of which everyone, more or less, has once in a lifetime
experienced.</p>

<p>This kelp has been put to a fraudulent use, for Sir Robert
Christison tells us that disease has been traced to an impure kind
of salt, in which, when investigated, the hydriodate of soda was detected,
resulting, he says, from an inferior salt obtained from kelp.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>In all those districts which are intersected by salt marshes, there
is almost a complete absence of miasmatic effluvia, though, as a
natural consequence, the vegetation is not of that rank luxuriance
which is invariably to be seen in other marsh lands; because,
whenever the soil is in a state of moisture, it is always covered
with all kinds of weeds and useless plants, which altogether stop
the growth of those which are of utility to the agriculturist.</p>

<p>In the case of salt marshes it is the reverse, and the neighbourhood
is perfectly free from those endemic diseases which are
prevalent in such localities as the fen-country, and other similar
districts; for the atmosphere is pure, and the soil comparatively
dry, and intermittent fever is unknown.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINAL AND DIETETIC PROPERTIES.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salt</span>, except by the ignorant, is generally acknowledged to be a
condiment, not only requisite as an adjunct to food, but also for
the animal economy; this fact is not to be lost sight of, and therefore
I lay much stress on it, and in the next chapter we shall see
<span class="pagenum">62</span>that physiologically it holds no mean position amongst those other
substances which are found in the human body.</p>

<p>There are a number of facts of physiological import, at which it
is necessary to glance, and which are indissolubly connected with
its medicinal and dietetic properties; and there are various others
illustrative of the absolute necessity of salt, which are self-evident
to those who think and observe, and which we will now proceed
to lay before the reader.</p>

<p>In human blood, salt is a most important constituent; where
there is disease, there is a diminution of salt, with corresponding
nervous depression, and the individual experiences a want of power:
if this want continues for any length of time, the health is gradually
undermined; the blood loses its richness and is deprived of its
vitalising property; various symptoms finally show themselves,
and probably develop into some phenomena of a serious significance—all,
indeed, indicative that the system is deficient of a most
important essential in its economy. These symptoms may prognosticate
the approach of various diseased conditions, partly owing to
the habits, constitution, or surroundings of the patient. In all
morbid conditions, and particularly in those which owe their origin
to an unhealthy state of the blood, we may, to a considerable
extent, be certain that there is a deficiency of the chloride of
sodium. In proof of this, patients never, as a rule, object to salt;
they actually relish it. Why? Because there is a deficiency, and
nature intuitively excites the desire. We often find that patients
refuse sugar; indeed the very mention of it produces a feeling of
nausea and extreme disgust: with salt it is entirely different; they
take it, and, in most cases, enjoy it in the same way that fever-stricken
patients long for, and relish, a draught of cold water, <i>if</i>
they are able to obtain it.</p>

<p>Were the human race once deprived of the chloride of sodium,
even for a limited period of time, we should not only lose a natural
healthful incentive for our food, but disease, with all her attendant
miseries, would spread with such relentless impetuosity as would
defy, and even paralyse, the efforts of the most skillful physician,
the ingenuity of the surgeon, and the scientific improvements and
hygienic precautions of the sanitarian.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> The strength and vigour
of manhood would fade as if blasted by disease, food would act as
a poison; the blood would not be replenished with the salt which
<span class="pagenum">63</span>it requires, and consequently our skins would soon be covered with
corruption; our cattle would die, our crops would be nipped in the
bud; the air would be full of offensive insects; the soil would
become foul and barren, the sea a waste of stagnant waters; and
all the beautiful productions of nature would wither and decay,
and our glorious earth would degenerate into a hideous solitude,
solely inhabited, very probably, by monsters horrible to behold, and
more repulsive than those gigantic reptiles which once roamed by
the dreary marshes of an incomplete world.</p>

<p>Those who take pleasure in decrying the inimitable works of
nature, and affirm that they are provocative of evil, can only support
their arguments by brazen assertions and subtle paralogisms.</p>

<p>Common salt is considered by most persons as a mere luxury, as
if its use were only to gratify the taste, although it is essential to
health and life, and is indeed as much an aliment or food as either
bread or flesh. It is a constituent of most of our food and drinks,
and nature has kindly furnished us with an appetite for it, though
there are not a few who regard it quite in another light: that
quadrupeds and birds (as I have before stated) should be fully
alive to the vivifying properties of salt, and that mankind should
be indifferent to, and in many instances totally ignorant of them,
is somewhat curious and incomprehensible, but it is so.</p>

<p>Another strange fact is, that savage nations use it freely with
but few exceptions: on the other hand, in civilised life there are a
great number who never touch it; but these abstainers little think
that they carry in their countenances visible signs of ill-health, and
their impurity of skin indicates that at some future time disease,
in some form or other, will cause them to regret, in more ways
than one, that their short-sighted neglect has prepared a soil ready
to receive the seeds of some fever, and other maladies more deadly
and obstinate.</p>

<p>Cutaneous eruptions, so distressing to the patient, and so disgusting
to an observer, flourish when they attack those who have
abstained from the use of salt.</p>

<p>Everyone perspires or sweats: the indolent perspire, the laborious
sweat. This distinction will be regarded as too fine by those who
entertain the opinion that perspiration and sweat mean the same
thing; this, however, is a great error; there is a marked
difference between perspiring and sweating, as much difference,
indeed, between these two processes of the elimination of refuse
animal matter, as there is between walking and running. It is true<span class="pagenum">64</span>
the same laws of nature are brought into play; but one is a modification
of the other. Those of a spare habit are seldom in a state
of general diaphoresis, and are only so when the weather is sultry,
or when they have taken a walk on a hot summer’s day. The
stout or plethoric, on the contrary, sweat copiously, even on the
slightest movement; and it is really a good thing for them that
they do, for otherwise they would very likely be attacked with a fit
of apoplexy, or would fall down from syncope; the former arising
from the flow of too much blood to the brain, or from rupture
of an artery; the latter resulting from an insufficient supply; or
the blood owing to its circulating in an impure state, which is
practically the case if there is a deficiency of salt, would generate,
not what is generally considered disease, but a condition which
would render the system prepared for the reception and development
of morbific influences.</p>

<p>During perspiration the blood is deprived, in proportion as the
diaphoresis continues, not only of the liquor-sanguinis, but of the
chloride of sodium which it holds in solution. Though to a certain
extent perspiration is an act of nature necessary for the continuance
of health, yet, if it goes beyond a point which is consistent with
an equalisation of the several secretions, the individual experiences
a diminution or loss of power, and nervous exhaustion or irritability
is the result. In natural diaphoresis the only way in which the
system can recuperate itself is by quenching the thirst; for free
perspiration is generally or almost invariably succeeded by a corresponding
thirst, varying in intensity according to the peculiar
idiosyncrasy of the individual.</p>

<p>Thin people do not perspire so copiously as those who are more
stoutly built, therefore they do not lose so much and neither do
they require so much fluid. Their blood, by reason of its retaining
its liquor-sanguinis and its chloride of sodium, does not require
salt as an aliment so freely as those who, owing to their profuse
perspiration, are in constant want of it. Stout people, or those who
have a superabundance of adipose tissue (for I must observe there
is a great difference between stoutness and obesity, though in
common parlance the two words are synonymous), require salt in a
greater degree than thin people. Well-developed muscles covering
a well-made frame, accompanied by a proper and due proportion of
fat, constitute stoutness of a healthy standard; but small muscles
covered with an overdue amount of fat, with an abdomen distended
to an offensive size (which is so frequently seen), seem, in my<span class="pagenum">65</span>
opinion, to determine a habit of a Vitellian obesity, if I may so
apply the name of that Roman epicure.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that stout and fat people perspire freely and
profusely, and to a much greater extent when undergoing fatigue,
they must necessarily lose a great amount of salt; for as it is held
in solution by the liquor-sanguinis, which passes through the pores
of the skin in the form of sweat (the word perspiration is not sufficiently
emphatic when we are speaking of stout and fat individuals),
it must naturally pass out with it, and thus they experience thirst
and a desire for salt; which desire is strongly indicative of a healthy
state of the secretions. If there is no wish for salt, then we may
conclude that disease in some form or other is lurking unsuspected
in the system, ready to break out, either by an act of indiscretion,
poisoned atmosphere, or because of a taint of an hereditary character.
We may compare this condition of things to a barrel of
gunpowder, ready on the application of the faintest spark to ignite,
and spread confusion and death far and wide, with a fury proportionate
to the amount of the inflammatory material. If these
people do not take salt with their food they allow their blood to
become impoverished and more unhealthy than it already is, and
their constitutions materially suffer in consequence, their skins are
ultimately affected, the complexion frequently becomes sallow, and
appears discoloured, and in some severe cases we have that skin
disease called acnæ, indicative of the poor and unwholesome state
of the blood; they are affected with intestinal parasites, they do
not digest their food, their breath has a most disagreeable odour,
very unmistakable, and they are more or less out of health.</p>

<p>Those of a scrofulous habit require salt to a much greater extent
than even the gross, because the blood of scrofulous or strumous
persons does not possess its due proportion of salt; and the only
way to make up for this deficiency is to use it freely, otherwise
the system does not derive the support and nourishment from that
source which vitalises the whole frame. We may justly infer that
if the blood is deficient of a most important constituent the system
must, as a matter of course, degenerate into a condition not only
ready to receive disease, but into one which reduces the strength
and undermines the nerve-power, and this in a scrofulous habit is
fraught with serious consequences.</p>

<p>The chronic inflammation which attacks the joints in scrofula
sometimes occurs, not so much from the unhealthy low state of the
system, but rather from the impure condition of the blood, result<span class="pagenum">66</span>ing
from the partial absence of salt. This must be the case, because
the sufferer experiences an increased vitality if salt is used more
abundantly; the change of course is gradual, and therefore we
must not expect to see one’s efforts immediately crowned with
success. It is sometimes necessary to explain to scrofulous
patients the unhealthiness of a persistent avoidance of salt, and to
point out to them the benefits accruing from it, and also to insist
upon their using it, because, owing to their ignorance of its operation
and their unwise dislike, they look upon it in the light of a
noxious compound.</p>

<p>I have frequently noticed (and I dare say others have observed
the same thing) the disfiguring eruptions with which many people
(and especially the young) of a scrofulous habit, and even some
who are free from this taint, are afflicted about the face and neck.
These pimples and blotches, when not caused by constipation, are
generally accompanied by a swollen condition of the glands, which
are sometimes acutely sensitive to the slightest pressure.</p>

<p>If we were to question them closely we should find that salt is
to them an almost unknown article of diet, or distasteful to them,
though no doubt it is, in some few instances, used but sparingly
and seldom.</p>

<p>The blood, more or less, is always undergoing a change, even in
health; the nitrogenised and non-nitrogenised substances are invariably
variable, and at no two moments are the salts of the same
proportion, its alkalescence always being in a constant state of variation.
Notwithstanding our increased facilities for obtaining a better
acquaintance with disease than formerly, the few facts which have
been satisfactorily made out show us that as yet we have made but
little progress as regards the morbid conditions of the human blood,
and that a great deal remains to be accomplished before we are
masters of the subject.</p>

<p>Amongst the chief diseases in which a pathognomonic condition
of the blood has been discovered is the increase of the fibrine, which
always takes place in inflammatory diseases, such as acute rheumatism
and inflammation of the lungs; in low fevers it is diminished;
it is also subject to variation in other diseases. In typhoid fever
the diminution of salt and the increase of fibrine is very marked;
and indeed in all inflammatory states of the system, especially of a
sthenic type, the partial absence or variation of the amount of the
chloride of sodium is a most important characteristic. No attention
has, up to the present time, been given to the relation which the<span class="pagenum">67</span>
presence of the chloride of sodium in the blood bears to disease, at
least not that I am aware of; and from what I have noticed it
opens up a question which in time will be considered of some
moment. As the chloride of sodium obviates the tendency of the
fibrine to coagulate, and as its coagulation or solubility is quite
dependent on its normal amount in the blood, it presents to us
many varied points of interest, not only physiologically, but medicinally,
though in this respect it has not yet been recognised as a
curative agent.</p>

<p>Whenever the blood is impoverished we may be tolerably certain
that salt is, in a greater or lesser degree, absent, or below the
standard, and that it is variable.</p>

<p>Now in scrofula the blood is not only vitiated, but poor in the
extreme, and there is a decrease of the fibrine; and that being the
case, the constitution suffers in proportion, the affection showing
itself in various ways, which unmistakably indicate the adynamic
state of that fluid which permeates the whole frame.</p>

<p>Scrofula and her twin sister struma, for there is a difference, are
low forms of chronic inflammatory cachexia, and are never entirely
recovered from. We may justly term them systemic diseases
originating local morbid phenomena, and which are always liable
to give rise to obscure attacks of an apparently serious nature, but
which are considerably modified if the treatment be simply
hygienic, judicious, and practical; scrofula is always tedious and
prolonged, and therefore, as I have said before, we must not
anticipate that because salt is of a nature somewhat antidotal to it
and its attendant evils, that its effects are to be observable instantaneously,
or that any very remarkable results must necessarily be
obtained. It is the reverse; the effects are slow in the extreme, but
the benefit is permanent—that is, if the treatment adopted be calculated
to restore to the blood that constituent so necessary for health.</p>

<p>This is easily explained—the unhealthiness of the system arising
from mal-nutrition, owing to the blood being more or less deficient
of a constituent which is necessary for the promotion of health,
and being solely constitutional, it takes some time to make up for
that deficiency, and to supply that which is lost. A disease of
long standing, and of an hereditary character, is not speedily
recovered from, particularly if the mischief is caused by, or is dependent
upon, an impure state of the blood, and if there is not the
normal amount of the chloride of sodium it must of necessity be
corrupt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">68</span></p>

<p>Though salted provisions are apt to produce scurvy if continued
for too long a time, yet in the case of those on board ship I do not
think it arises exclusively from the salt itself, but by the unwholesome
food upon which the toilers of the sea are obliged too often
to subsist. The biscuits, which are of the coarsest kind, and sometimes
worm-eaten, are certainly not calculated to keep up the
stamina of the men; and the salt pork which they have three or
four times a week is not exactly the food to promote a healthy
condition of the blood; neither is the soup, which is little better
than rice water, capable of even satisfying the cravings of hunger.</p>

<p>Besides, there is a very miserable custom, and which tends to
ruin the health of our sailors, and that is the drink which is, I may
say, encouraged on board ship, and officially served out to them
daily, in the shape of rum, though of late they can have cocoa if
they prefer. So habituated have they become to this that no
captain would think of suggesting a diminution of the supply.
Our sailors, poor fellows! will stand anything but the deprivation
of their “grog;” they do not mind being crowded like beasts of
burden in a close, stifling forecastle, eating coarse biscuits or unwholesome
pickled pork, so long as they are duly supplied with
their “grog” and allowed to go “ashore” and spend their contemptible
pittance on poisonous compounds which burn their
stomachs and sow the seeds of some deadly disease, and especially
if they happen to be in the tropics.</p>

<p>All these inseparable accompaniments of nautical life are, without
doubt, provocative of scurvy to a certain extent, and I am sure
do not help to stave it off. If rum is taken on an empty
stomach, day after day, as regularly as clockwork, we cannot expect
that the men should be in a state of sound health, or that their
blood should be pure; particularly if the voyage is long, the
biscuits worm-eaten, the pickled pork of a questionable condition,
sometimes even approaching putridity, and the rice-soup—upon
which I shall abstain from passing any remarks, further than by
saying that it is decidedly not of that quality tending to act as a
substantial sustentation of men who work hard, and who are exposed
to all weathers, both by night and by day. Indeed it is
surprising that they can perform their duties as they do when we
call to mind their irregularities, their daily use of spirits, and their
periodical alcoholic indulgences when ashore, combined with their
abominable diet on board ship.</p>

<p>Though salted provisions solely are not altogether conducive to<span class="pagenum">69</span>
health, or contributive towards preserving the due equalisation of
the constituents of the blood, I cannot see that they entirely
originate scurvy, as some assert; I am of an opinion that this
disease is caused principally by seamen’s peculiar habits, and the
surroundings belonging to a seafaring life, joined, much more
frequently than some would like to confess, with the ingestion of
animal food just rescued from putrescence by a timely immersion
in brine.</p>

<p>Everything, as is well known, can be used and abused, and salt,
like other natural productions, owing to human avarice, can be put
to a purpose so as to derange and render nugatory the laws of
health. We know full well that salt completely arrests the
formation of putrescent larvæ in meat, if it is rubbed in when
fresh, or if it is well soaked in strong brine; and if the meat is
bordering on decomposition, we may prevent it proceeding to a
more advanced stage by immersing it in brine; still it is not in a
condition fit for human consumption. Such food in my opinion is
of a nature calculated to produce disease of a most virulent type;
indeed it is quite sufficient to produce the worse form of scurvy, let
alone the outbreaks of a milder degree.</p>

<p>I am acquainted with the fact that a diet consisting exclusively
of salt pork and salt beef, with very little variation or change,
would be, if continued for any length of time, combined with the
absence of fresh vegetables, productive of much mischief, and in
the end no doubt scurvy would be the result; but for us to assert
that every outbreak of this disease is produced by salted provisions,
is to run into a very ridiculous error, and we fall into a trap cunningly
laid for us by those whose interest it is to keep up this preposterous
imposition in the eyes of the not too discerning public.
If shipowners took more care in provisioning their ships with
wholesome food, instead of allowing them to be stored with bad
pork, putrid beef, and rotten biscuits, we should not read the
heart-sickening accounts so frequently in the newspapers. It is
all very well for them to assert that the disease springs from salt,
and the absence of vegetable food; it is to their interest to say so.
We can cast their flimsy statements to the winds, however, and give
them an emphatic contradiction, for their proceedings in this matter
will not bear even a partial investigation.</p>

<p>I have gone more fully into this part of my subject than I
intended, for the following reason: the advocates of total abstention
from salt invariably bring forward scurvy as a conclusive proof<span class="pagenum">70</span>
of their argument, and as unanswerable; they have not looked at
it, I am afraid, from the above standpoint, and I think if they
will take the trouble to go into the matter more thoroughly, they
will find that scurvy originates, not from wholesome salted provisions
and the want of vegetables, but from impure and putrid
food, which too many owners of ships, from pecuniary motives,
prefer to supply, not for the passengers—that would of course be
unwise policy—but for the men who labour for them on the
waters, and who are at the mercy of employers as insatiable and
inexorable in obtaining their pounds of flesh as the storm-tossed
ocean yawning for its victims.</p>

<p>“Digestion is the process by which those parts of our food
which may be employed in the formation and repair of the tissues,
or in the production of heat, are made fit to be absorbed and added
to the blood.”</p>

<p>I do not think it will be out of place to make a few cursory
observations on the process of digestion, for as scurvy is the result
of the ingestion of unwholesome food, we cannot do better than
consider the process in relation to salt, and its action on animal
and vegetable food while it is in the stomach.</p>

<p>When this organ is empty it is completely inactive; there is no
secretion of the gastric juice, and the mucus, which is slightly
alkaline or neutral, covers the surface; but immediately food is
introduced, the mucous membrane, which was pale, at once becomes
turgid, owing to the greater influx of blood; because when
any organ has work to perform, it requires an increased supply.</p>

<p>The amount of the gastric juice secreted has been variously estimated
to be from ten to twenty pints a day in a healthy adult, and
by the following table, we find that salt, or rather the chloride of
sodium, is present in a considerable quantity. Looking, then, at
the immense secretion of the gastric juice, salt is really in continual
requisition, making it self-evident that if the supply is not
kept up in the same ratio, digestion is retarded, the food passes
out of the stomach in an undigested state into the duodenum, and
the stomach is consequently overstrained because of the loss of one
of its most important constituents; the supply of salt not being
equal to the demand.</p>

<p>In a sheep’s gastric juice there is to 971·17 of water, 4·36 of
chloride of sodium, showing at once how highly necessary it is for
cattle to be supplied with it; a sheep will consume on the average
half an ounce of salt daily; that it tends to prevent an outbreak
of the rot, I have already drawn the attention of the reader.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>There is we see 0.20 of <i>hydrochloric acid</i> to 994.40 of water in
the gastric juice, though some are of an opinion that it is <i>lactic
acid</i>; the weight of evidence is decidedly in favour of <i>free</i> hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p>Food when it is going through the process of digestion is reduced
to a pulp by the solvent properties of the gastric juice, which are
due to the presence of the animal matter or pepsine, and the
hydrochloric acid; neither of these two constituents can digest
separately, they must be together; and they must be in that proportion
as we have before us in the preceding table; to act as complete
disintegrators and solvents.</p>

<p>The general effect of digestion is the conversion of the food into
what is called <i>chyme</i>; and though the various materials of a meal
are entirely dissimilar in their composition, whether they are
azotised or nitrogenous, and non-azotised or non-nitrogenous; when
they are once reduced to this condition, viz., <i>chyme</i>, they hardly
admit of recognition.</p>

<p>The reader may naturally suppose “that the readiness with
which the gastric fluid acts on the several articles of food, is in some
measure determined by the state of division, and the tenderness and
moisture of the substance presented to it,” and he may also be
aware of the fact, that the readiness with which any substance is
acted upon by the gastric juice, does not necessarily imply that it
possesses nutritive characteristics, for it stands to reason that a
substance may be nutritious, and yet hard to digest; and when
this is the case, the gastric follicles supply a greater quantity of
fluid, in order to effect the conversion of the food into chyme.
<span class="pagenum">72</span>
Pepsine and the hydrochloric acid, the two indispensable and inseparable
solvents, are consequently secreted in greater abundance
in order to meet and overcome the difficulty, so that the food
may be in a condition fit for assimilation with the various tissues.</p>

<p>Man requires a mixed kind of aliment, therefore he must have
animal as well as vegetable food, though there are many instances
of people who live wholly on animal or vegetable substances; these
of course are anomalies, and therefore their habits are unnatural.
Vegetarianism is a foolish freak of the weak-minded and semi-ignorant;
the structure of the teeth of man points conclusively
to the fact that he is both carnivorous and herbivorous; though
these vegetable philosophers would have us believe that he is
destined to feed upon cabbages!</p>

<p>Food is divided into two groups, nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous,
or animal and vegetable; the only non-nitrogenous organic
substances of the animal, or nitrogenous, are furnished by the fat,
and in some few cases by those vegetable matters that may happen
to be in the organs of digestion of those animals who are eaten
whole.</p>

<p>Nutritive or plastic, is given to those principles of food which are
converted into fibrine or albumen of blood, and being assimilated
by the various tissues through its medium, and those principles
comprising the major part of the non-nitrogenous food, in the form
of fat, gum, starch, and sugar, and other substances of a similar
nature, are supposed to be utilised in the production of heat, and
are termed calorifaciant, or sometimes respiratory food. The principal
ordinary articles of vegetable food contain identical substances,
in composition, with the fibrine, caseine, and albumen, which constitute
the chief nutritive materials of animal food; for instance,
the gluten which is present in corn is identical in composition with
fibrine, and is therefore called vegetable fibrine; legumen, which
exists in beans, peas, and other seeds of the leguminosæ, is similar
to the caseine of milk; and albumen is most abundant in the seeds
and juices of nearly all vegetables.</p>

<p>On carefully analysing the preceding remarks on food and some
of its uses after it has been digested, and the composition and
properties of the gastric juice, it is obvious that salt is not only a
simple adjunct to food, and therefore not of much importance, but
is an article of diet in every sense of the word, and as necessary,
if not more so, than many aliments which are regarded as
essential.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">73</span></p>

<p>In its relations to animal or nitrogenous, and vegetable or non-nitrogenous,
food, salt is in every respect important.</p>

<p>The hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, which is so bountifully
secreted by the glands of the stomach, of course drains the
whole system of its salt, and especially does it draw the chloride of
sodium from the blood, which contains 3·6 in 1000, being held in
solution by the liquor-sanguinis.</p>

<p>Animal or nitrogenous food contains only a minimum of salt,
which chiefly exists in the muscular tissue, its principal constituents
being albumen and fibrine; if, therefore, it is eaten as a rule
without salt, digestion is by no means facilitated, because meat
being comparatively tough, the glands have to secrete an increased
quantity in order to break down or disintegrate it, and there is, as
I have observed, a greater drain on the system.</p>

<p>Vegetable or non-nitrogenous food contains potash; only those vegetables
growing near the sea contain soda. The same reasons which
apply to animal food hold good as regards vegetable, with this difference:
the gluten, the legumen, and their other ingredients are acted
upon by the gastric juice more rapidly, and that being the case, a less
amount is required, and as a natural consequence less salt, or rather
chloride of sodium, is abstracted from the blood; because the more
the stomach is called upon to exert itself, a greater flow of blood
to that viscus is the result, which takes place only when the food
to be acted upon is of a harder or tougher material than ordinary,
when the organ is filled to repletion, or when salt is omitted as
a rule.</p>

<p>Another fact should be borne in mind: cellulose is a substance
invariably present in the vegetable kingdom, and is found both
in low and high plants; it is present in the fungus as well as in
the palm, in the lichen as well as in the oak; it is not subject to
climatic influences nor to atmospheric changes, so that its quantity
in all plants is always the same. This cellulose is almost identical
in its composition with starch, which is a substance entirely non-nutritious.
When in the system starch undergoes a transformation,
by some process not as yet clearly defined, into sugar; whether in
the stomach or by some action of the liver, physiologists are uncertain,
but it is an unexplained physiological fact, nevertheless.
Sugar, we know, is a very active agent in the production of fat;
therefore it is not desirable for us to have an overplus, but rather
to keep it under. Salt is not a fat-producer; it has an opposite<span class="pagenum">74</span>
effect; therefore it should be used plentifully with vegetable food
in order to neutralise the effect of the starch or cellulose.</p>

<p>We thus see that this substance cellulose is identical with starch;
that starch is turned into sugar, and that sugar promotes the
growth of fat. I have already mentioned that stout and fat
persons require more salt than those who are spare; therefore we
may see at a glance how necessary it is for us to use salt liberally
with oleaginous food, and indeed with all which tends to increase
the adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Those who have a predisposition to obesity, and who wish to
reduce their bulk, cannot take better means to obtain the object of
their desire than to use salt at all their meals, and to take care
that their food is of the plainest; then with a proper amount of
exercise and attention to the secretions, they will find that instead
of carrying a distended, cumbersome abdomen about with them,
attended with miserable inconveniences, they will have the felicity
of experiencing not only a diminution of size, but a more easy and
expeditious locomotion; and they will be enabled to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">“Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff</div>
<div class="line">Which weighs upon the heart.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>If they wish to effect their purpose more speedily, Glauber’s salt
waters, which contain salt, can be taken with advantage, for they
decrease the fat and assist digestion and assimilation. “In the
same way chloride of sodium may be shown to be a more important
ingredient than is sometimes supposed. It stimulates
gently the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, and also the
muscular fibres of the intestines; when absorbed it promotes tissue-change,
and apparently aids the cell formation. Its digestive
action is well known.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>According to Dr. Rawitz, who has examined microscopically the
products of artificial digestion and the excreta after the same food,
cells, both animal and vegetable, pass through the alimentary
canal completely unchanged, such as cartilage and fibro-cartilage,
except that of fish, which fact is indicative that it is more digestible
than any other aliment; elastic fibre is also unchanged, and
fat-cells are frequently found altogether unaltered; also after eating
fat pork, the pabulum of the lower classes, crystals of cholesterine
are invariably to be obtained from the excreta.</p>

<p>Quantities of cell-membrane of vegetables are found in the alvine
<span class="pagenum">75</span>evacuations, likewise starch-cells, with only part of their contents
removed, and the green colouring principle, chlorophylle, is never
changed.</p>

<p>From the foregoing we see at once the kind of food necessary,
as regards its sustentative and nutritious properties, and that
which merely serves as an unimportant adjunct.</p>

<p>Dr. Rawitz does not inform us whether a greater or lesser
amount of salt was used in his experiments; being regarded as
an unimportant item, he probably may have been indifferent
as to whether it was used or not, and took no note of the
quantity. As nothing was found in the excreta belonging to fish,
we may regard it as favouring the view, that being impregnated
with salt, and living in salt water, the facility with which it is
digested is mainly owing to the presence of salt. Fresh-water fish,
as is well known, are not digested so easily and thoroughly as
those which live in the sea. Again, Dr. Rawitz does not tell us
whether the fish used in his experiments were salt or fresh; I
conclude that they were salt, because the consumption of fresh-water
fish is considerably below the number of that caught at sea.</p>

<p>Those who believe that man is an organism of vegetable proclivities,
and would have him live upon vegetables exclusively, who
point with a triumphant smile to scurvy as resulting solely from
long-continued abstention from vegetable food, combined with the
ingestion of salted meat, should remember that any kind of food
indulged in to the exclusion of others injures the health, reduces
the physical strength, and deteriorates the blood. They are right
as far as their argument goes, but they lose sight of some very
remarkable facts when they describe scurvy as originating from
salt.</p>

<p>Vegetables which are generally used as aliment are young and
fresh; on board ship, and especially in long voyages, they are
in nine cases out of ten old and musty, and those belonging to the
compositæ, such as cabbages, rapidly degenerate into decomposition,
generating a very poisonous gas, viz. sulphuretted hydrogen;
while those belonging to the leguminosæ, as peas and beans, lose
their great nutritious principle, legumen, which is identical with
the caseine of milk, and which renders them such invaluable articles
of diet. Besides, if vegetables are kept for any length of time,
even if excluded from the air, they are liable to rapid decomposition
immediately they are exposed to its influences. I therefore think,
as I have asserted already, that salted meat is not wholly respon<span class="pagenum">76</span>sible
for scurvy, and that it much more frequently arises from its
being salted in the early stages of putrescence.</p>

<p>These vegetable reformers and abstainers from salt are, I am
afraid, ignorant of these facts.</p>

<p>If mankind were to act in accordance with the wishes of visionaries,
and those who are prone to scientific credulity, and who look
upon themselves as philanthropic philosophers, we should speedily
be reduced to the unenviable condition of the Frenchman’s horse;
for to some, animal food is pernicious, salt is in some respects
poisonous, water is to be discarded as worse than useless, stimulants
in the hour of sickness are to be avoided, and are never to be
touched; vegetables are mere woody fibre or starch-cells. They
are considerate, however; they have left us fish! This staple of
food is not yet ostracised.</p>

<p>Happy is the man who lives according to the dictates of nature,
temperately and wholesomely, and who does not run like a thoughtless
being into extremes, originating from hare-brained fanatics,
and from unpractical utilitarians.</p>

<p>Salt is a preventive of those disfiguring eruptions which frequently
affect the young about the face and neck, and which in the majority
of cases arise from a defective state of the blood. One need only
take a stroll through a crowded thoroughfare to find that this
is the fact. These young people, instead of possessing complexions
which are indicative of health and purity of blood, carry in their
countenances unmistakable marks which cannot escape the eye
of an observant and discriminating passer-by. If we were to
make inquiries, we should find that they are, with few exceptions,
absolute strangers to salt, and that probably they have been
brought up from their infancy by their parents never to touch it.</p>

<p>This neglect shows the grossest ignorance on the part of these
people, and calls for the most stringent censure; it is almost incredible,
to find so many unaccustomed to the use of salt, and
who never impress upon their children the need of it, and that
the continuance of their health is partly dependent upon a daily
use of a substance which is a highly important constituent of the
blood.</p>

<p>I have drawn my reader’s attention to the facts that the blood
of scrofulous persons is deficient in salt, that the amount is variable,
and that the deficiency is at once discernible in the objectionable
condition of the skin of the face and neck; but here we
have people enjoying a fair share of health, who, owing to ignorance<span class="pagenum">77</span>
or indifference, are reducing themselves to a state bordering
on disease, and who would otherwise be total strangers to those
ailments which only attack the impure, the luxurious and intemperate.</p>

<p>We have seen that salt is necessary in the animal economy, otherwise
it would not exist as a constituent of the blood. It is
equally necessary for the preservation of health; for in the blood
of those people who are suffering from disease, we detect a visible
decrease. In some cases of fever the diminution is remarkable;
if the febrile symptoms increase in severity, we find that there is
a corresponding loss of the chloride of sodium. This simple fact
alone shows that it is the imperative duty of those who have at
heart the well-being of their fellow-creatures, to impress upon them
in emphatic language, that if they wish their blood to be in a
pure healthy condition, and to be able to ward off the insidious
attacks of disease, they must make it a frequent article of diet.</p>

<p>We are all cognisant that disease will be to the end of time one
of the scourges of humanity; and at the present day certain
maladies are spreading amongst us with the greatest rapidity, all
our efforts to eradicate them having been hitherto altogether futile,
and the results far from promising. All our medicines, our improved
modes of treatment, and our hygienic schemes, ingenious
as they undoubtedly are, reflecting the highest honour on their
philanthropic originators, have been, and still are to a considerable
extent, abortive, and we are still combating with, and succumbing
to, this inveterate enemy of mankind.</p>

<p>We do not diet ourselves as we should; in this respect we are
far behind the veriest savage, cannibal though he be: he in his
natural state obeys the laws and dictates of nature, which we in
our civilised state decidedly do not, notwithstanding the assertions
of the dreamy philosophers of the day. He sleeps when nature
prompts him, regardless of the sun’s heat or midnight dews; he
eats when he is hungry, and drinks when he is thirsty; he goes
through a certain amount of physical fatigue; his clothing is of the
simplest kind; his food on the average is the purest; his drink is
that natural fluid which we, owing to our high state of civilisation,
so pertinaciously and foolishly discard; he roams at pleasure either
on the desert or in the forest; and his impulses, though savage, are
never at variance with nature; he is, in fact, as real a child of
nature as an average civilised European is the slave of a falsified
nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">78</span></p>

<p>Those who have travelled in the islands of the Pacific Ocean
have informed us that their inhabitants, with but few exceptions,
possess the secret of extracting salt from certain substances, which
indicates that even they are fully alive to its virtues, and proves to
us, who boast of our superiority, that we are deficient of natural
acumen, or that it is marred and stultified by those silly customs
arising from that curse of civilisation, fashion, which makes slaves
of us all, at least of the weak-minded and frivolous.</p>

<p>At the tables of the wealthy it is perfectly absurd to see the
small amount of salt which is placed in the smallest receptacles, as
if it were the most expensive article; and it is equally ridiculous to
see the host and his guests, in the most finical grotesque manner,
help themselves to the almost infinitesimal quantities of salt, as if
it were a mark of good breeding and delicacy. This is how we
pervert nature; our civilisation is a great good, undoubtedly, but
at the same time it is frequently at variance with what is good for
us. If the blind votaries of fashion think that it is polite to use
the gifts of nature in such a way as to render them comparatively
useless, let those who wish to enjoy the blessings of health, pure
blood, and a wholesome, transparent skin, refrain from those stupid
customs of “good society,” which are truly indicative of mental
weakness and most profound ignorance.</p>

<p>I have known people who accustom themselves to the use of salt
baths, and who talk very glibly of the luxury of sea-bathing, who
yet are in complete ignorance of the virtues of salt as a condiment
and as a preserver of health, and who try to prove that salt so
used is obnoxious, and consequently to be avoided. These salt
baths are popular, not because they are beneficial, but by reason of
their comparative novelty; and accordingly, many who would not
think of using salt with their food, plunge headlong into the sea
or into a salt-water bath, with all the vigour possible.</p>

<p>Salt baths are presumed by some to be of great value in gout;
Droitwitch in particular is famous for them; many who were considered
as incurable have alleged that after having used them, they
have returned home cured.</p>

<p>The topical application of salt water to weak joints, etc., has
only just come to the front; and by many it is regarded as quite a
new remedy; and I have heard some very disparaging observations
on the medical profession regarding its negligence to, or indifference
of, the restorative properties of salt water, alleging that it
has been reluctantly forced to advise it, in deference to the popular<span class="pagenum">79</span>
opinion in its favour. It is indeed a fact that until a few years
ago, medical men as a rule were utterly unacquainted with salt
water as a remedial agent; and the idea no doubt would have
been denounced with as much asperity and contumely as the
hydropathic treatment is at the present day, and with as much
reason. It is a mistake, however, to assume that it is of recent
origin, for my father, Mr. Wm. Barnard Boddy, has been in the
habit of advising it for over the last sixty years, and with almost
uniform success.</p>

<p>Intestinal worms, which so frequently infest the impure, rendering
them somewhat offensive to themselves, generate much more
rapidly, and take a firmer hold on their victims, even if there is
but partial absence of salt in the blood, and particularly if pork
is frequently an article of diet. I have known many instances in
which they have been expelled, and the intestines thoroughly
freed from them, on a more liberal use of salt, for it is certain
death to these parasites, helping to root them out, and destroying
them, whether they belong to the tape, the round, or the thread
variety.</p>

<p>Children, we know, are more liable to have these parasites than
adults, with the exception of the tape-worm; particularly is this
the case with those of the labouring and agricultural classes,
and with children who are fed upon rich dainties. With regard
to the agricultural class, it is, I think, easily explained. People
who live in the country—I refer, of course to the poorer sort—allow
their children to run about wherever they please, especially
in the spring and summer time; the cottage door and
the small garden are generally the places where they assemble;
or the neighbouring lane or meadow, if the weather is at all
favourable; where they may be seen rolling and tumbling about,
picking up what they can find if at all edible, and soon putting
their discoveries into their mouths with apparent relish. The
British cottagers, not being at all particular as to whether their
vegetables are clean or not, swallow, as well as their children, any
insect that may be ensconced in the half-cooked cabbage, or unwashed
celery or water-cress. Another reason is, I think, of more
weight than the preceding two, and that is, they very seldom think
of using salt at meal-time, though it is sometimes to be seen on
their tables. The English working-classes are nearly, if not altogether,
unacquainted with the benefit of salt, and very few indeed
utilise it as they should; so that we can easily understand why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
they are so infested with intestinal parasites, which thrive in
such a soil, and increase, in some instances to an enormous extent.</p>

<p>The embryo of the tape-worm, called the <i>echino-coccus hominis</i>,
in such cases finds a fitting and a secure home, and soon develops
into its tape-like form, and with wonderful tenacity keeps firm
hold; so that sometimes it is difficult, or even impossible, to effect
its entire removal, especially if it has existed for any length of
time, and particularly if the individual indulges often in pork; for
as its source is undoubtedly measely pork, such a course of diet
nourishes it and imparts an increased vitality. I have known
them to exist in some people notwithstanding the most energetic
and judicious treatment, not only for many years, but for a lifetime;
and in the end to cause the death of their victim. Sailors,
by reason of their wretched diet, are frequently troubled with this
parasite.</p>

<p>Whenever these intestinal parasites exist they are indicative,
not only of foul diet and abstention from salt, but also of impure
habit, and prove conclusively that the individual is more or less a
stranger to salt.</p>

<p>The latter is more commonly the origin of these pests, and shows
us how careful we ought to be as to what we eat; for we may
well suppose that the ingestion of pork, vegetables half-washed,
and abstention from salt is just the kind of diet favourable for the
reception of the embryo, and for its speedy development.</p>

<p>Lord Somerville, in his address to the Board of Agriculture
some years ago, states that the ancient laws of Holland “ordained
men to be kept on bread alone, <i>unmixed with salt</i>, as the severest
punishment that could be inflicted upon them in their moist
climate: the effect was horrible; these wretched criminals are
said to have been <i>devoured by worms</i>, engendered in their own
stomachs.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Medical and Physical Journal</i> (vol. xxxix.) Mr. Marshall
tells us of a lady who had a “natural” (I should say unnatural)
aversion to salt, and who was afflicted with worms during the whole
of her lifetime. Can we imagine anything more horrible or more
disgusting than a person, owing to a foolish prejudice, being in
such a foul and impure condition? The enjoyment of life was out
of the question, and there can be no doubt that she was in a constant
state of ill-health; she must have been, if she had any refined
feelings, loathsome to herself, and yet, at the present time, there<span class="pagenum">81</span>
are many in the same plight, who would not touch the smallest
particle of salt on any account whatever, or probably would do so
with extreme reluctance.</p>

<p>There is another very interesting parasite called the <i>cysticercus
cellulosæ</i>, originating from diseased pork; it is found in subjects of
the leuco-phlegmatic temperament; it is met with in the muscles
of the thigh, in the muscular tissue of the heart, and in the brain
and eye. If the pork containing this parasite is well soaked in
strong brine and thoroughly cooked, no harm will accrue; another
fact, I must observe, showing the great importance of salt as an
edible.</p>

<p>The thread-worm, technically termed the <i>ascaris vermicularis</i>,
generally met with in children, is speedily got rid of if a solution
of salt is injected into the rectum, combined with the administration
of an anthelmintic and pure diet, with a regular use of salt,
and a little attention to cleanliness.</p>

<p>While we are upon this question of worms we may with some
advantage consider that modern disease—if we may designate parasitical
development in muscular tissue as such—which has for
some time riveted the attention of scientists, and has all but
foiled their endeavours to elucidate; I refer to <i>trichinosis</i>, a condition
caused by the introduction of a most minute organism,
called the <i>trichina spiralis</i> (from its being coiled up in transparent
capsules), in various muscles of the body, and particularly in the
deltoids and other muscles of the arms. Sporadic outbreaks of
this incurable disease have occurred at various times and of variable
intensity, but always with the most alarming results.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we possess no means of detecting the <i>trichinæ</i>
when they have once been introduced into the system; we may
by the symptoms be led to suspect that they are present, but that
is as far as we can go; and if we are to believe Professors Delpech
and Reynal it is utterly impossible to discover them; they affirm,
however, that in cut meat the larval capsules, or lemon-shaped
cases, can only just be seen by the aid of a powerful lens.</p>

<p>In the outbreak which took place in the year 1863 at Heltstaädt,
28 out of 153 persons succumbed; sufficiently exemplifying the
fatal character of these infinitesimal organisms; for they may
exist in thousands, and even in millions—some say twenty millions—in
their miserable victim. So virulent is the disease originating
from this parasite, and so insidious in its operation, that in its
primary stage it is liable to be mistaken for rheumatism, on account<span class="pagenum">82</span>
of the severe muscular pain; and in fact the sensitiveness of this
tissue is so much increased that those muscles which are concerned
in the mechanism of respiration give rise to such excruciating
pain that the sufferer is quite unable to sleep; indeed, so extreme
is the muscular sensibility that the slightest pressure causes acute
suffering.</p>

<p>The latter stages simulate typhoid fever, or more correctly, the
disease drifts into a typhoid condition, for the symptoms are of
that peculiar exceptional character which are presumed to be indicative
of this much misunderstood fever. It has, however, been
ascertained that those attacked are rarely, if ever, able to endure
the long and exhausting course of this disease, but break down,
utterly worn out by the unceasing ravages of these prolific and
voracious little parasites.</p>

<p>The French, with that acuteness which is natural to them, soon
discovered that by good and thorough cooking the <i>trichinæ</i> can be
destroyed; and they further ascertained that they cannot survive
a temperature of 167° Fahrenheit, and also discovered that if
meat is <i>well salted</i> the <i>trichinæ</i> are rendered perfectly harmless;
in fact, they are killed by the chloride of sodium quite as effectively
as by the application of heat.</p>

<p>This is another unanswerable argument in favour of a more
general use of salt, quite sufficient to convince the most stubborn
disbeliever; for here we have a parasite which may at any time
be introduced into the stomach, let us be as careful as we may;
capable of generating myriads in an almost incredible short space
of time, and which it is next to impossible to effect the removal
of; in the end causing much physical suffering, and producing
symptoms liable to be mistaken for those of a dangerous disease;
and finally disintegrating those muscles in the fibres of which
they live, procreate, and gradually destroy the life of a human
being.</p>

<p>The greatest triumph of engineering skill the world has ever
seen, the St. Gothard railway tunnel, was the cause of a great
sacrifice of life and health owing to a disease engendered by the
presence of intestinal parasites, resembling the <i>trichinæ</i>; and we
learn from Professor Calderini, of Parma, and Professors Bozzolo
and Pagliani, of Turin, that from 70 to 80 per cent. of the miners
suffered from this complaint, which they have designated <i>anæmia
ankylostoma</i>. Among the men who worked in the tunnel for about
one year 95 per cent. were more or less affected; they likewise<span class="pagenum">83</span>
discovered that those who are thus attacked never entirely recover.
Many reasons for this enormous fatality have been assigned, such
as the vitiated state of the atmosphere, the difficulty of ventilation,
the continual explosions of dynamite, the consumption of which
was 660 lb. per day, the smoke and smell from 400 to 500 oil-lamps,
and the exhalations from the men and horses. There was
an entire absence of sanitary appliances, and the temperature was
generally between 80° and 95° Fahrenheit. These surroundings
were quite sufficient to account for this great sacrifice of human
life, not to mention other causes.</p>

<p>The diet of these men was probably insufficient and of inferior
quality, and I dare say if more crucial inquiries were instituted we
should find that these miners were as a rule inattentive to personal
cleanliness, and that they never used salt at any of their meals;
if this were so, and I cannot help thinking that my surmises
are correct, we have one great cause all but sufficient for bringing
about a condition of the system favourable for the development of
<i>anæmia ankylostoma</i>.</p>

<p>The presence of these parasites in the intestines of the men who
worked in the St. Gothard Tunnel has been proved beyond
question by a careful and prolonged series of microscopic examinations
by Dr. Giaccone, a physician in the employ of the contractors
at Airolo. It is stated that Dr. Sonderreger, of St. Gall, who has
been assisting Dr. Giaccone in his experiments, has discovered a
process by which these parasites may be completely extirpated.</p>

<p>A pestiferous atmosphere is bad enough in itself, but when it is
associated with impure diet—and food I maintain is impure if it
is cooked and eaten without salt—we have a state of things which
will prepare a soil where intestinal parasites will develop to a
marvellous extent.</p>

<p>It is somewhat interesting to know that a similar disease is
endemic in Egypt and Brazil, and that it arises from the presence
of the <i>ankylostoma</i> in the intestines.</p>

<p>Poor diet no doubt is the real cause of this condition, and a
great proportion of the inhabitants, as is well known, of these two
countries subsist principally on food, not only non-nutritious, but
impure in the extreme, which being coupled with the fact of
habitual abstention from salt, brings about, as I have said before,
a condition of things very favourable for the reception, generation,
and development of parasitical organisms.</p>

<p>The outbreak which occurred in the St. Gothard tunnel originated<span class="pagenum">84</span>
from the impurity of the food with which the workmen were
supplied, and the absence of salt, could we but fathom the real
truth of the matter, though we must not lose sight of the fact that
the surroundings were every way calculated to facilitate the growth
of disease.</p>

<p>The medicinal properties of mineral waters are of great value in
some conditions of the system, especially those resulting from high
living and when associated with habitual indulgence in those
alcoholic beverages which tend to cause congestion of the liver.
These people are not what one would designate as intemperate,
but whose partial physical prostration and irregularity of the secretions
have been brought about by luxurious living and the unnecessary
use of stimulants, combined with unhealthful indolence,
and other pernicious habits, which are considered to be of the
highest importance by those unhappy votaries of fashion.</p>

<p>Thousands of patients, and many who fancy that they are such,
flock to those localities which are famous for their mineral waters;
thousands go and thousands return, some better, some worse, and
some in the same state of health as when they started: all declare
that they are better for their trip, and it may be only a few are
acquainted with the constituents of the water they have been
drinking; many, if they knew that they are all derived from
rock-salt, and that the other constituents to which their curative
powers are ascribed are only added as the brine ascends to the
surface, would be not a little amazed at their inconsistencies: to
refuse to eat salt at meal-time because it is supposed to be deleterious,
and then to drink, it may be, tumblerfuls of the solution,
is somewhat curious.</p>

<p>As all mineral waters originate from rock-salt, and as they all
owe their other constituents to superincumbent strata, it would not
be unreasonable to suggest that the chloride of sodium is, <i>prima
facie</i>, their principal ingredient, and that their beneficial effects
are to a certain extent due to it, more than to the presence of those
from which their names are derived; though of course there is no
denying the fact that some mineral waters are more suitable for
some constitutions than others.</p>

<p>One would not advise individuals of plethoric habits to drink
those waters which are termed chalybeate, nor those whose kidneys
are affected to drink acidulous or carbonated waters; we should
recommend quite the reverse.</p>

<p>Mineral waters have a somewhat evanescent popularity; one is<span class="pagenum">85</span>
rapidly succeeded by another: one that was highly eulogised is
now neglected, and those which are now in favour will be, in all
probability, discarded in a few years. At the present time there
are many, though not a few holding a very precarious position in
public estimation.</p>

<p>Glauber’s Salt Waters, as the name indicates, owe their medicinal
properties to the presence of the sulphate of soda, chloride of
sodium, and other salts. They are more nauseous than Epsom
salts, and slightly more irritating; the first may depend upon the
condition of the palate, the other on the weakness or obstinacy of
the alimentary canal. These waters contain saline aperients which
exercise no little influence on the change of tissue; a result which
should make them find great favour with patients who wish to
diminish their bulk without affecting their muscles.</p>

<p>These waters contain the chloride of sodium, the presence of
which is, in my opinion, of more benefit than all the other salts
put together, and which, if absent, would deprive the waters of
their efficacy, or at least effect such modifications as would render
them practically of but little use.</p>

<p>All these mineral waters come from brine-springs, and whether
they are called chalybeate, carbonated, saline, or hepatic waters,
whether they come from Spa or Tunbridge Wells, from Carlsbad
or Ilkestone, from Püllna or Cheltenham, Buxton, Friedrichshall,
Droitwich, or Wiesbaden, their common origin is rock-salt, and to
that mineral alone their virtues are principally due; the iron,
magnesia, lime, and the other salts which they collect on their
upward course are merely accessories, and are more useful to the
proprietors than to the credulous recipients. They are purged
freely, they are dieted carefully, and the blood is purified, and the
result is of course beneficial; they could do the same at home, but
then a weak solution of salt and magnesia or iron looks very
homely when put side by side with some Carlsbad<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> or Friedrichshall
waters: there is a great deal in a name, and the more nauseous
a compound is the greater are its medicinal virtues; so think
some.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">86</span></p>
<p>In all fevers, whether epidemic, endemic, or sporadic, the blood
is thicker than ordinary, by reason of an increase of the fibrine and
a decrease of the chloride of sodium; because the fibrine, which
always has a tendency to coagulate, is not kept in check by the
solvent properties of the chloride of sodium; this alone accounts
for their partiality for salt.</p>

<p>In rheumatic fever the blood is even thicker than it is in other
fevers; in acute rheumatism the patient is generally bathed in
profuse perspiration night and day, and the sweat contains a good
deal of lactic acid. The acid in the gastric juice is supposed by
some physiologists to be lactic acid, whilst others affirm that it is
hydrochloric acid; there is, however, such a similitude that one
acid is barely distinguishable from the other. The blood in this
fever therefore loses much more salt than in other febrile conditions,
which explains the acute pain in the joints and the desire
the patient has for salt. Blood in a thickened condition cannot
pass through the blood vessels near joints without giving much
pain, owing to the unyielding nature of the parts; and the fibrine
also has a tendency to stagnate if the blood does not flow as it
should.</p>

<p>In some cases of sickness, when not accompanied with vomiting,
half a teaspoonful of salt in a little water is sometimes most effective.
Whenever there is a feeling of nausea the stomach is relaxed,
there is the usual amount of the gastric juice, but it is deficient of
the hydrochloric acid; therefore a small solution of salt takes the
place really of the acid, and the sickness is relieved, it likewise
supplies the chloride of sodium, which has been abstracted from
the gastric fluid.</p>

<p>In violent attacks of colic, if there is no other remedy at hand,
a teaspoonful of salt in a pint of cold water, which the patient
may sip, is most speedy in relieving the sufferer. The same will
also relieve a person who has had a heavy fall and is partly unconscious.</p>

<p>In hæmorrhage from the lungs, when the usual remedies have
failed, a solution of salt will sometimes arrest it. When applied
to a cut the bleeding ceases. These little facts are well worth
knowing, because salt is always to be found in every home, and so
may be given or applied in case there is no medical man at hand;
matrons and nurses of small hospitals, infirmaries, and workhouses
should be acquainted with them in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>We have now before us the properties of salt in a medical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
dietetic sense; that indirectly it is a therapeutical agent of some
value cannot be denied; that it is an important aliment is a fact
which cannot be explained away; and that it is a preserver of
health all must allow.</p>

<p>That it is of a deleterious tendency is a mere assertion as unsubstantial
as “thin air,” and as flimsy as gossamer—<i>magno conatu,
magnas nugas</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prejudice</span> is the daughter of ignorance; and nothing exemplifies
the truth of this more thoroughly than the senseless repugnance to
salt which is now so remarkably prevalent. Ask these persons for
their reasons, if we can dignify them as such, for disliking salt;
their answers, as a rule, will be trifling platitudes, altogether unworthy
of refutation, or even of moderate attention.</p>

<p>Objections founded on imperfect, or an affectation of knowledge,
are not worth the trouble of confuting, even if they be supported
by a fair amount of intelligence; but when the opponents of salt
begin to base their assertions upon science, and demur on medicinal,
dietetic, and physiological grounds, then we must meet them
armed with similar weapons to those they have chosen, with the
handling of which they are but imperfectly acquainted, and which
therefore recoil upon them in such a way as prove that though
they may be shrewd, they are but badly informed and credulous
scientists.</p>

<p>At the present day the science of physiology has arrived at such
a pitch of perfection that there is not a single secretion, tissue, or
organ of the body, with the exception of the spleen, which has not
been investigated, and the functions divulged and made so plain
that it is quite divested of that apparent mystery which formerly
enshrouded it; though our kind friends, the anti-vivisectionists,
would willingly adopt the most unjust measures to prevent the
study of life from being more perfect than it already is: they protest
with well-feigned horror at a frog or a rabbit, under the influence
of chloroform, being experimented upon for the benefit of
humanity, while they see, without allowing a sign of disapprobation
to escape from them, an inoffensive hare chased to death for<span class="pagenum">88</span>
the amusement of gentility, and probably gloat over, with pleasure,
the dying agonies of a stag: a sight which gratifies the
somewhat questionable proclivities of refined and elegant ladies,
who race their horses out of breath to gaze on the sanguinary scene.</p>

<p>Had it not been for physiological research we should not have
known that the chloride of sodium was such an important constituent
in the animal economy; we should have been in utter
ignorance of the science of life, and we should never have known
how man is begotten, how developed, or how he dies. With
regard to the two processes of decay and repair, or how the human
organism, from a mere cell, gradually becomes a being highly organised,
mentally as well as physically, we should have known
nothing. Physiology has been a boon to humanity and an inexhaustible
field of research to the scientific.</p>

<p>In a chemical point of view there is no more important mineral
constituent in the human body than the chloride of sodium, for it
occurs nearly in every part of the system, both solid and fluid, in
close and intimate relation with the organic compounds, and it
materially influences their chemical and physical properties; for
instance, the albumen partly owes its solubility to the presence of
salt, the quantity of which causes the differences which it presents
as regards its coagulation; pure caseine, which is quite insoluble, is
dissolved at once on the addition of common salt; and if it is
added in increased proportions it impedes the coagulation of the
fibrine. Another remarkable physiological fact is that the chloride
of sodium is not only uniformly present, but its various proportions
are nearly definite and constant, both in the fluids and tissues;
and the existence of a provision for the limitation of the quantity
kept in the system causes the proportions to be little affected, in
the way of excess at least, by the amount of salt the food may
contain, that is, if the diet is wholesome and the individual healthy.</p>

<p>According to Lehmann, who experimentalised on himself, the
blood may contain in a normal state 4·14 parts of the chloride of
sodium in 1000, and after a meal of very salty food it may be only increased
to 4·15; he says it only rose to 4·18 when two ounces of salt
had been taken an hour before, and two quarts of water had been
drunk in the interval. The blood will not receive more than a
certain amount; and as an over-amount of salt will produce extreme
thirst, a quantity passes through the kidneys with the water that has
been drunk; frequent drinking of course causes frequent micturition.
If we take the mean of numerous observations by several<span class="pagenum">89</span>
experimenters, the average quantity of urine voided by healthy
adult males is about 52-1/2 fluid ounces; this quantity may contain
urea to the amount of 512·4 grains, chlorine 105·0 grains, and soda
125·? grains, besides other salts and extractives. If such an amount
passes out with the urine we can easily account for the slight increase
in the blood of Lehmann.</p>

<p>The quantity of the chloride of sodium in the blood is liable to
great variation in different diseases; and there can be little doubt
that this variation is closely connected (though whether in the
relation of cause or in that of effect, we are not exactly entitled to
surmise) with the histological and other transformations of the
component parts of the blood. The proportions of salt greatly
differ in several tissues, and also at different periods of the development
of the same tissue. “Thus in muscle,” according to
Enderlin, “100 parts of the ash left after incineration of ox-flesh
yielded nearly 46 per cent. of the chloride of sodium and potassium;
which, as this ash constitutes 4·23 per cent. of the dried
flesh, would give 1·94 as the proportion of the chloride of sodium
in 100 parts of the latter; and reckoning this dried residue to
constitute 28 per cent. of the whole substance of the muscle (the
remaining 77 parts being water) the proportion of chloride of
sodium in the latter will be 0·44. These figures, as will be
presently seen, bear a remarkably close correspondence to those
which represent the proportion of chloride of sodium in the ash,
solid residue and entire mass of the blood.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>Next to muscle, cartilage contains the largest amount of the
chloride of sodium, and this especially in the temporary cartilages
of the fœtus, its place being taken by the phosphate of lime as it
approaches the time of birth. The percentage of the chloride of
sodium contained in the ash of the costal cartilage of an adult is
about 8·2; in the laryngeal cartilage 11·2; but as the ash does not
constitute above 3·4 per cent. of the entire substance the percentage
of the chloride of sodium in the latter is, at the most, 0·38 of the
whole, or less than that of blood and muscle. Only from 0·7 to
1·5 per cent. could be extracted from the ash of bone.</p>

<p>Besides the important uses of the chloride of sodium in the
blood to which we have already adverted, it serves the purpose of
furnishing the hydrochloric acid required (by many animals, at
least) for the gastric secretion; and it likewise supplies the soda-base
for the alkaline phosphate, whose presence in the blood appears<span class="pagenum">90</span>
to serve a most important purpose in the respiratory process.
Moreover, there is reason to think, from the experiments of Boussingault
upon animals, as well as from other considerations, that
the presence of salt in the blood and excreted fluids facilitates the
deportation of excrementitious substances from the blood. The
proportion in which it occurs in the principal animal fluids is
represented by the following table, constructed by Lehmann chiefly
from his own analyses; it is highly interesting, and shows us at a
glance that it is more important in the economy than any other
substance, and is significant of the fact that health cannot exist
long if the chloride of sodium is below the normal amount.</p>

<p>We have thus proved physiologically that the chloride of sodium
holds a most prominent position among the other constituents
of the body; that it is present in considerable quantities in
muscle as well as in the blood; and that it furnishes the acid,
which is necessary for the stomach to perform its functions of
digestion. It holds the albumen partly in solution, and its coagulation
is dependent more or less on the amount of salt which is
present in the blood, and it also possesses the power of preventing
the coagulation of the fibrine. In fevers the blood is generally
thicker, and has a tendency to coagulate by reason of the partial
absence of salt, because a good deal passes off with the perspiration;
and fever patients always prefer salt to sugar, for while one refreshes
them and helps to restore the usual healthy tone of the
palate, by constringing the papillæ of the tongue, the other raises
feelings of disgust.</p>

<p>It is also present in cartilage, though in a lesser degree than in
blood or muscle, because in cartilage there is no disintegration or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
waste of tissue, and therefore it does not require such a perpetual
supply; there is, on the contrary, a continual loss going on in
muscle, especially during exertion. Perspiration is to a certain
extent the principal medium which carries off the chloride of
sodium, owing to its being held in solution by the liquor-sanguinis;
during fatigue, particularly if prolonged, a greater quantity passes
off, producing various degrees of thirst. That the normal proportion
of the chloride of sodium should be regularly maintained must
be obvious.</p>

<p>In febrile disease the fibrine of the blood is materially increased,
and there is also a marked decrease of salt, which is dependent on
a greater or lesser intensity of the attack, rendering the blood
denser, owing to the fact of the tendency of the fibrine to coagulate
by reason of the diminution of the chloride of sodium, causing the
blood to circulate slowly and with difficulty.</p>

<p>In some other morbid conditions, which we have already
noticed, the blood becomes thinner and poorer; and consequently
the system degenerates, and we get an anæmic, or chlorotic tendency,
especially if there is a scrofulous diathesis. There are
other blood diseases, as the reader may suppose, and which are
more truly such, than those to which I have just alluded, into the
phenomena of which it is not necessary to enter.</p>

<p>In health what a decided difference! the specific gravity of
the blood is uniformly equable;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> it circulates with comparative
ease; and the whole system is permeated with the life-giving and
health-preserving chloride of sodium, and the coagulation of the
fibrine is prevented by nothing else but that mineral and inorganic
substance—salt, which at the same time purifies and maintains the
equalisation of the constituents of the blood. By it also the hydrochloric
acid is supplied to the stomach, enabling that organ to
perform its functions of digestion in accordance with the laws of
health; and it likewise furnishes the alkaline phosphate “whose
presence in the blood appears to serve the most important purpose
in the respiratory process.”</p>

<p>What stronger evidence do we require to prove the salutary
efficacy of salt? No wonder that it is so frequently reverted to in
Holy Writ; neither can it be a source of surprise that it has
been so carefully cherished and extensively utilised from time
immemorial. What is to be regarded as an extraordinary anomaly
is that there are not a few who are entire strangers to its virtues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>and who prefer impurity and defilement to the luxury of health
and cleanliness.</p>

<p>Those who desire more conclusive proof of the utility of salt, of
its necessity in the animal economy, and of the peculiar morbid phenomena
to which its absence in the system gives rise, I would refer
to two articles which appeared at different times in the <i>Medical
Press and Circular</i>, and in the <i>Medical Times and Gazette</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> The
cases I there mention occurred in different localities, and they demonstrate
incontestably that parasites, especially the <i>lumbrici</i> (the
<i>tæniæ</i> are well known to infest adults of impure habit), are sometimes
the origin of strange and incomprehensible symptoms of a
deceptive character, rendering diagnosis extremely difficult and unsatisfactory,
and frequently endangering the lives of the sufferers.
Is it not a blessing to know that nature has munificently provided
a means whereby these distressing evils may be checked and
definitely eradicated by a daily use of such an enemy to, and
destroyer of, disease as the chloride of sodium, universally known
as common salt?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">CONCLUSION.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is invariably a relief when one’s task is completed, and more so
when it is self-imposed. Putting our thoughts and opinions upon
paper for others to peruse and to criticise, is pleasure combined with
not a little anxiety; for one cannot with any degree of certainty
predict what kind of reception one’s efforts may have from the
public, who are frequently led to a choice of books on the recommendation
of critics and reviewers; so that an unknown author is
placed at a great disadvantage, and at the mercy of those who may
laud a book to the skies if they please, satirically criticise another,
and pass over a third with a sarcastic smile or a significant shrug of
the shoulders. I am afraid that my little volume will unfortunately
be found amongst the latter, but I candidly acknowledge that I
hope it will be regarded as belonging to the first, or at least to the
second.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">93</span></p>
<p>As I have simply written it in order to point out the virtues of
an aliment of the greatest interest in whatever light we may look
at it, I trust that if I have not instructed, I have at any rate
afforded pleasure to those who have thought it worth their while
to glance over its pages; and I shall be quite contented if they
have derived as much satisfaction in reading, as I have experienced
in writing it.</p>

<p>I have tried to impress upon the reader the advisability, and
indeed the necessity, of using the bountiful gifts of nature in a manner
consistent with common sense, and not to follow blindly and
credulously the whims and conceits of others, but to regard their
frantic efforts to indoctrinate the thoughtless, with that dispassionate
indifference which is the sign of philosophical complacency and
superiority. Lucretius says truly that “nothing is more delightful
than to occupy the elevated temples of the wise, well fortified by
tranquil learning, whence you may look down upon others and see
them straying in every direction, and wandering in search of the
path of life.”</p>

<p>Approbation is pleasing, and particularly so when it comes from
those who are more able to judge impartially and correctly than
others; and censure, if deserved, though far from gratifying, is not
of a nature to intimidate or to create discouragement.</p>

<p>With these concluding remarks, and certain misgivings, I now
submit my short work to the indulgent consideration of those who
read for the sake of obtaining information, those who read for
amusement only, and to those who peruse literary productions
with the eye of criticism. Lord Bacon advises us to “Read, not
to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor
to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. Some
books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to
be chewed and digested. That is, some books are to be read only
in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to
be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.”</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must say that I sincerely hope that the candid
reader has reaped improvement where the critic may have found
only matter for censure.</p>

<p>A., page <a href="#Page_38">38</a>. “Occasionally lakes are found which have streams
flowing <i>into</i> them, but none flowing <i>out</i>. Such lakes are usually
salt. The Caspian Sea in Asia is an example. It is called a
sea from its great extent, but it is in reality an inland lake of
salt water.”</p>

<p>B., page <a href="#Page_80">80</a>. Mr. William Barnard Boddy on “Diet and
Cholera”: “The nourishment we derive from the flesh of some
animals is not so compatible with the well-being of our constitutional
wants as others, particularly the swine, which was altogether
prohibited by the Jewish lawgiver, independent of its
spiritual enactments, because it produced ‘leprosy.’ Now pork is
largely consumed in England, especially by the poorer classes, and
in ninety-nine cases out of every hundred is almost invariably succeeded
by diarrhœa; and we need not be surprised at this when
we look at the filthy habits of this animal; its impure feeding
and liability to the diseases of measles and scarlet-fever. But
when we know that they are often in this state killed and sold
as an article of food, the liability to disease of course is much
greater. But this is not all, as relates to this class of society, for
almost—I might say positively so—every article upon which they
subsist is impoverished by vile adulterations, and worse, putrefactions;
their limited means enabling them to procure only the half-decomposed
refuse of the vegetable market, and the half-tainted
meat from the butchers’ shambles.</p>

<p>“The more wealthy command all the luxuries of life in abundance,
and, agreeable to their inclinations and appetites, feast accordingly.
Over-indulgence however, often repeated, at last exhausts the
healthy tone of the stomach, and blunts the keen edge of desire;
and in order to produce a false appetite, condiments of various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
kinds and degrees are substituted; so that, in fact, the food becomes
nearly as vitiated by these additions as that of the poor
man’s by subtractions—the one of necessity, the other of choice.
Extremes meet, and here ‘the rich and poor meet together;’ for
under both circumstances the animal economy must severely suffer,
and the ‘blood, which is the life,’ becomes weak and serous; and
though for a time, from the great reluctance health has to depart,
the growing evils of an impure and unwholesome diet may not be
perceived or apprehended, yet insensibly, from the perpetual inroads
made upon the constitution, and the delicate seat of life, the efforts
to resist disease become weaker and weaker, till at last the whole
mass is left without any internal active principle of sound health
available to resist or overcome its effects.”<br /><br /></p>

the Plain,” or “of the Arabah,” and “The East Sea.” In the 2nd Book of
Esdras v. 7, it is called the “Sodomish Sea.” Josephus uses a similar name,
ἡ Σοδομύτυς λίμνη—the Sodomite Lake; he also calls it by the same name as
Diodorus Siculus, the “Asphaltic Lake”—ἡ Ἀσφαλτίτις λίμνη. It contains
26 per cent. of salt, including large quantities of magnesium compounds; its
weight is of course great, a gallon weighing almost 12-1/2 lb.; and its buoyancy
is proportionate to the weight, being such that the human body cannot sink in
it. At the south side is a mass of crystallised salt, and in it is a very peculiar
cavern, extending at least five miles, varying in height from 200 to 400 feet.
This sea is 1312 feet below the level of the Mediterranean; the river Jordan,
from the Sea of Galilee, flows into it, but no river flows from it.</p></div>

of the Stoics, who was born about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 300, and who says that “a soul was given
to the hog instead of salt, to prevent his body from rotting;” by this we see
he was quite cognisant of the preservative properties of salt.</p></div>

a province of Hindostan, also the Indian Salt Range, which stretches in a
sigmoid curve, according to the late researches of Mr. Wynne, from Kalabagh
on the Indus to a point north of Tank, both the Chinese and Hindoos may

been that the expelled Shemites carried back with them into Syria the arts

gypsum <i>Selenite</i>; powdered calcined gypsum forms <i>Plaster of Paris</i>. The
fibrous gypsum has a silken lustre, and is used for ear-rings, brooches, and
other ornaments. Fibrous gypsum of great beauty occurs in Derbyshire;
veins and masses of this substance abound in the red marls bordering the
valley of the Trent.</p></div>

the above-mentioned famous German Spa. The well, although artesian, is
only so to a partial extent, and a pump of a novel construction raises the
water from 128 feet, and delivers it at the surface.</p></div>
